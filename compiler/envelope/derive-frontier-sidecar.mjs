/**
 * derive-frontier-sidecar — many per-exposure ladder frontier documents into one
 * `vibeguard.ladder-frontiers/1` sidecar, mapping a nominal six-axis config key
 * to the frontier that was measured at it.
 *
 *   node derive-frontier-sidecar.mjs --out <path> <frontier.json> [...]
 *   node derive-frontier-sidecar.mjs --out <path> --dir <dir-of-frontiers>
 *
 * The sidecar sits beside the fallback table and is consulted before a cell is
 * quoted: the driver measures the ladder under the build in hand, looks the
 * build's config key up here, and hands both frontiers to `frontier-match.mjs`.
 * A mismatch refuses the quote.
 *
 * ★ THE COLLISION RULE — the single most important decision in this file.
 *
 * Two frontier documents can map to the same config key and still disagree. That
 * is not a defect in the inputs and it is not noise to be smoothed: IT IS THE
 * PHENOMENON THE GUARD EXISTS TO DETECT. The nominal key carries six axes — cc,
 * freestanding, lto, ndebug, opt, target — and measured on the driver's own
 * `normalise()` + `driverConfigAxes()`, the key for `-O2` is byte-identical to
 * the key for `-O2 -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`, for
 * `-O2 -fno-builtin-memset`, for `-O2 -ffast-math` and for
 * `-O2 -fstack-protector-strong -fPIC -march=native`. When two such builds
 * respond differently to the ladder, the key has been shown to be unable to tell
 * two exposures apart. So a collision is NEVER merged, NEVER averaged and NEVER
 * resolved last-one-wins:
 *
 *   * the key is written out as unusable, carrying `health.broken: true` and no
 *     frontier, so that a consumer running it through `compareFrontiers` gets
 *     `exposure-incomparable` rather than an arbitrary winner;
 *   * the collision is recorded in `anomalies`, naming both sources and every
 *     rung they differ on. The precedent is `derive-fallback-table.mjs`'s
 *     `anomalies` array: excluded, but never silently.
 *
 * Picking a winner would be strictly worse than having no sidecar at all. The
 * guard would then answer `exposure-consistent` for whichever of the two builds
 * happened to lose the coin toss — a confident wrong answer produced by the very
 * component that was added to stop confident wrong answers.
 *
 * ★ GUARD ONLY, PERMANENTLY. Nothing here may be merged into a
 *   `vibeguard.fallback-table/1` row or into an envelope cell. A ladder frontier
 *   is a (ladder-subject, config) measurement of a synthetic specimen and says
 *   nothing about the user's subject. `derive-fallback-table.mjs` documents
 *   keying by propertyId rather than by (subject, config) as its mistake #1;
 *   letting a frontier fill or select a cell is that mistake one level up.
 *
 * THE KEY DISCIPLINE
 *
 * The six axis names and their order are the ones `derive-fallback-table.mjs`
 * fixes in its `CONFIG_KEYS`, and a config is canonicalised the same way: exactly
 * those keys, in that order, missing ones written `null`. They are restated here
 * rather than imported, and the duplication is deliberate on both counts. The
 * two files must AGREE, because a sidecar keyed differently from the table it
 * guards would silently guard nothing — so a test pins the list. And they must
 * not SHARE code, because the one thing this sidecar must never become is an
 * input to that table, and a shared module is the first step of exactly that
 * merge.
 *
 * ★ WHERE THE VALUES COME FROM, WHICH IS NOT THE DOCUMENT
 *
 * A frontier document states no `config`, and it is right not to. What it
 * records is the invocation it measured — `exposure.opt` and
 * `exposure.extraArgs`, the line that was actually compiled — plus the compiler
 * that compiled it at `toolchain.cc`. Turning that line into six axes is a
 * READING of a command line, and this tree has exactly one: `normalise()` in
 * `compiler/driver/lib/cmdline.mjs` followed by `driverConfigAxes()` in
 * `compiler/driver/lib/config-axes.mjs`. Both are imported here and the reading
 * is not re-implemented, in bash, in Python or in this file.
 *
 * That import does not contradict the paragraph above. What must not be shared
 * with `derive-fallback-table.mjs` is the axis vocabulary, and it still is not;
 * what IS shared is the driver's reading of an argument list, and sharing it is
 * the whole point — the driver looks this sidecar up by the key its own reader
 * produced, so a second reading here would not disagree visibly, it would MISS,
 * and a sidecar that silently has nothing to say about any build looks from the
 * driver's side exactly like a clean run. Nothing flows from this file into the
 * table in either direction.
 *
 * A `null` axis is recorded as an anomaly rather than accepted quietly. A key
 * with a null axis is a key that under-specifies the build even more than the
 * six axes already do, so two more genuinely different builds land on it.
 *
 * FAILURE DIRECTION
 *
 * Fails towards exposure-consistent. The ladder is a single-TU synthetic
 * specimen: cross-translation-unit inlining, profile data, -march code
 * generation, stack-protector variants and everything downstream of the IR
 * optimiser are invisible to its three extractors, so two genuinely different
 * exposures can present identical frontiers. A consistent reading is necessary,
 * never sufficient. The opposite direction is clean: with a deterministic
 * compiler a differing frontier under an identical ladder is evidence of a
 * differing exposure, and refusing to quote the cell is the correct reading.
 * Measured limits, clang 18.1.3 on 2026-08-17: -O2, -O3 and -Os are
 * indistinguishable to this rung set, and so are _FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and =3. Any
 * command line carrying an LTO token is refused at measurement time rather than
 * measured.
 *
 * A frontier binds the flag sequence and the compiler and NOT the header set:
 * `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` is a header rewrite, so two builds whose argv and clang are
 * identical but whose images ship different headers key the same, frontier the
 * same, and are not told apart here. The contract that closes that gap is
 * operational and belongs to whoever runs the sweep — THE LADDER IS MEASURED IN
 * THE SAME IMAGE AND THE SAME JOB AS THE BUILD IT GUARDS — and a sidecar
 * assembled from documents measured in some earlier container is a lookup table
 * of other exposures. Relatedly, a build whose command line carries a
 * path-bearing flag (`-I/usr/local/include`, `--sysroot=/opt/vendor`) never
 * reaches this file at all: interfaces.md section 5 keeps host paths out of a
 * digested document, so the assembler refuses instead of redacting, and
 * vendor-sysroot and cross builds are outside this guard's coverage rather than
 * loosely inside it.
 *
 * The paragraph is emitted into the sidecar itself, at
 * `instrument.failureDirection`, so that a reader who has only the artefact is
 * told what a consistent reading is worth.
 *
 * EXIT CODES (interfaces.md section 7)
 *   0  a sidecar was written. NOT a claim that every key is usable — a run in
 *      which every key collided exits 0, because the collisions are the finding
 *      and destroying the report of them would be the worse outcome. The stderr
 *      summary always states how many keys came out usable.
 *   1  the command line is wrong
 *   2  an invariant failed: the entries do not account for every input document,
 *      or an entry contradicts itself. No sidecar is written, because a sidecar
 *      that quietly dropped an exposure is worse than none
 *   3  nothing to derive from: no input was named, or one of the inputs could
 *      not be read or was not the documented shape. One unreadable document
 *      fails the whole run rather than being skipped — skipping it would drop an
 *      exposure from the collision search, which is the one thing this file is
 *      for

  // ── seal it ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // Until 2026-08-18 this document was written unsealed, and it was the ONE
  // direction in which a refusal could be turned into a pass. Everything else in
  // the chain is checked: the measured frontier's own `evidenceDigest` recomputes
  // from its bytes, the fallback table names the envelope digest it was derived
  // from, and every entry's stated `configKey` is recomputed from the config the
  // entry carries. But the REFERENCE side of the comparison — `entry.frontier`,
  // the reading the build in hand is compared against — was trusted on nothing
  // but the bytes on disk. Editing one rung of it turns `exposure-mismatch` into
  // `exposure-consistent`, which is the failure direction this instrument already
  // fails towards, so the edit would not even look like a disagreement.
  //
  // The verifying side was written first and has been waiting: `fallback.mjs`
  // checks `evidenceDigest` "only when a digest is there to check", and says in
  // as many words that it fires "without another edit here" once this deriver
  // starts sealing. This is that edit. Nothing in the reader changes.
  //
  // `sealRecord` is the generator-side chokepoint, and calling it here is
  // deliberate rather than incidental: `fallback.mjs` re-derives §5 from the
  // written rules instead of importing `canon.mjs`, because "two sides that share
  // an implementation agree by construction and the agreement proves nothing".
  // The generator is the side that is allowed to use the shared implementation.
  //
  // `context` is attached by the same call. It is stripped from the top level
  // before the digest by §5 rule 1, so the sidecar's digest stays byte-stable
  // across runs even though its `generatedAt` does not — the determinism the
  // pipeline is measured on is preserved, and the digest is a statement about the
  // readings rather than about when they were collated.
  //
  // The absolute-path gate above is left where it is. `sealRecord` runs its own,
  // and would THROW; this one returns EXIT_INVARIANT with the offenders named,
  // which is the more useful failure for a deriver whose whole job is to collate
  // other people's documents. Reaching `sealRecord` therefore means the check has
  // already passed, and its gate is a backstop rather than the primary.
