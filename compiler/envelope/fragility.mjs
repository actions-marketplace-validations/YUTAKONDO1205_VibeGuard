/**
 * Optimisation Fragility Score — a summary statistic over a configuration
 * envelope matrix.
 *
 * The number this file produces answers one question: across the configurations
 * that were actually measured, in what fraction did a declared security
 * property fail to hold? 0 means it held everywhere that was measured; 1 means
 * it failed everywhere that was measured.
 *
 * "Fail to hold" is polarity-dependent and is read from the cell rather than
 * assumed — see POLARITY_TABLE. For a must-survive property that is `LOST`; for
 * a must-not-appear one it is `PRESENT`, because there the forbidden thing
 * going away is the property working.
 *
 * Everything difficult about this file is in the word "measured".
 *
 * A cell whose control did not hold is a broken measurement, not a survival
 * (compiler/schema/interfaces.md section 4: "A measurement where the control's
 * count also fell to zero is a broken measurement, not a finding"). A cell whose
 * verdict did not complete, or whose state is NOT_OBSERVED, is an absence of
 * evidence, not evidence of survival (section 3: the last two states "exist
 * because 'we did not see it' and 'it is not there' are different claims and
 * merging them is how a checker starts lying"). Counting any of those on the
 * surviving side lowers the score, which is the direction that reads as safe —
 * so this file removes them from the denominator instead, and reports every
 * removal. An envelope in which most cells were thrown away must not be
 * indistinguishable from one in which most cells survived.
 *
 * Two consequences follow, and they are the reason this is a module rather than
 * three lines at a call site:
 *
 *   * A matrix with no eligible cells has no score. It is refused (exit 3,
 *     interfaces.md section 7), never reported as 0.0. Zero divided by zero
 *     rendered as "nothing was lost" is the exact shape of claim this directory
 *     exists to prevent.
 *   * A score is never emitted without the envelope it was measured over. A
 *     property observed to survive -O0 and -O1 has not been observed to survive
 *     -O3, and "fragility 0.00" quoted without the config list says otherwise.
 *     `toEvidenceJson` and `formatReport` both refuse to render a report whose
 *     `measuredConfigs` is missing or empty.
 *
 * Numbers in the emitted evidence are integers and the score is a `{num, den}`
 * pair, per interfaces.md section 5 rule 4. `scoreAsFloat` exists for callers
 * that want to compare or display one; its result never reaches the record.
