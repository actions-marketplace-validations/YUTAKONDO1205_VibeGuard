# IrCheckpoints — the pre-optimisation and post-optimisation observers

An out-of-tree LLVM pass plugin that reads one IR unit at two checkpoints and
says which of six states a declared security property is in there. It is written
against `compiler/schema/interfaces.md`; that file is the contract and is not
edited from here.

The component exists for one distinction:

| | |
|---|---|
| `LOST` | The effect is gone and the thing it acted on is still there. |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | The representation changed, so the question no longer has the same referent — the buffer was promoted out of memory, or the unit was inlined away and deleted. |

Collapsing those two is how a checker of this kind becomes a false-positive
generator. At `-O2` a great many buffers stop being buffers, and reporting each
one as a removed wipe buries the one case where a wipe really was deleted.

`NOT_APPLICABLE` is also not a pass. The record carries
`verdict.completesTheCheck: false` for it, so a caller maps it to exit 3 rather
than to a clean build.

## Building

```sh
cmake -S compiler/llvm-pass -B ~/vg-build/llvm-pass -G Ninja \
      -DLLVM_DIR=$(llvm-config-18 --cmakedir)
ninja -C ~/vg-build/llvm-pass          # -> ~/vg-build/llvm-pass/libIrCheckpoints.so
```

Nothing is built or measured under `compiler/`. Measurement output goes to
`~/vg-lab/llvm-pass/`.

## Running the measurement

```sh
bash    compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/run-matrix.sh      # produces records
python3 compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/check-matrix.py    # grades them; 0 / 2 / 3
```

`run-matrix.sh` decides nothing and `check-matrix.py` compiles nothing, so the
code that produces a number is never the code that grades it. The expectations
in `check-matrix.py` were written from what each fixture is for; a cell that
disagrees is printed as a disagreement rather than edited into agreement.

## The extractors

There is no generic graph normaliser here, deliberately. A normaliser has to
decide what "the same thing" means for every property at once, and the decision
it makes for a wipe is not the one a fail-closed branch needs. Each extractor
carries its own notion of the effect and of the object the effect acts on, and
puts both in the record.

| extractor | counts | `NOT_APPLICABLE` when |
|---|---|---|
| `ir.wipe-effect` | call sites to a wipe symbol **plus** inline stores of a zero constant into a stack object or a pointer parameter | the wiped stack object was promoted out of memory, or the unit is gone |
| `ir.guarded-call` | call sites to a deny symbol, but only while some conditional branch in the unit still tests a value | the unit is gone |
| `ir.forbidden-callee` | call sites to a forbidden symbol; opposite polarity, a non-zero count is the finding | the unit is gone |

The zero-store half of `ir.wipe-effect` is not a convenience. Above `-O0` the
compiler is entitled to render a wipe either as a call or as inline zeroing, and
an extractor that knows only the call form reports the *control* as lost, which
makes the whole measurement worthless.

## The oracle rules, and how they are obeyed

`interfaces.md` §4 gives three rules. Each is obeyed structurally and then
measured, so the obedience is a number in the record rather than a claim in a
comment.

**Walk call sites, never the symbol table.** Effects are counted by walking
`CallBase` and resolving `getCalledFunction()`. The naive alternative is kept
and recorded next to it so the two can be seen disagreeing in the same run. In
the `residue` fixture at `-O2`:

```
oracleDivergence.callSiteOracle.pass                          DSEPass          (observation 68)
oracleDivergence.nameLookupOracle.sweptByPass                 GlobalOptPass    (observation 131)
oracleDivergence.observationsBetween                          63
oracleDivergence.declaredButUncalledWhenTheCallLeftTheUnit    ["llvm.memset.p0.i64"]
```

That is the failure the rule prevents, measured: the call went at `DSEPass`, the
leftover `declare` stayed for 63 more pass observations, and a name lookup would
have named the global-cleanup pass as the cause.

Note that the declaration is swept *before* the post-optimisation checkpoint, so
the residue is only visible mid-pipeline — which is why the after-pass probe
exists and why looking only at the two endpoints would have missed it.

**Count inside one IR unit.** The `inlined` fixture at `-O2`: the subject's
per-unit count is 0 while `naiveOracle.moduleWideCallSitesPostOpt` is 2. The
effect is still in the program — it moved into the caller — so the per-unit
reading has to be `NOT_APPLICABLE`, and a module-wide count would have reported
it present in a function that no longer exists.

**Carry a control that cannot be removed.** Every cell names a co-resident
control unit and every record carries `control.held` and
`control.minEffectObserved`. A run in which the control also fell to zero sets
`held: false`, emits `VG-PROP-003`, and sets `completesTheCheck: false`.

## The fixtures

| fixture | subject | shows |
|---|---|---|
| `erasure` | `handle_request` | a wipe that is a dead store; `LOST` at `-O2`/`-O3`, attributed to `DSEPass` |
| `promotion` | `use_token` | the same source compiled twice, one `-D` apart: `NOT_APPLICABLE` without the escape, `LOST` with it |
| `inlined` | `scrub_and_report` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` because the unit was inlined and deleted, while the effect is still in the module |
| `residue` | `handle_request` | the two oracles disagreeing about the same module in the same run |
| `authz` | `serve`, `serve_folded` | a guard that survives and a guard that folds |

`promotion` is the load-bearing one. Both of its cells compile the same file and
both show the effect count going `1 → 0`; a checker that decides from the count
alone must give them the same verdict. It does not, and the record says which
fact separated them:

```
                              effect 1→0   allocasEscapingToOpaqueCall   post allocaSizes   verdict
promotion-escape-off -O2      yes          0                             []                 NOT_APPLICABLE
promotion-escape-on  -O2      yes          1                             [16]               LOST
```

## Positive controls

A check that cannot fail is not checking anything. Four cells exist to fail, and
`check-matrix.py` fails the run if they stop failing.

| cell | breaks | must produce |
|---|---|---|
| `pc1-no-discriminator-O2` | `OBS_DISABLE_MEMOBJ_DISCRIMINATOR=1` — the `LOST`/`NOT_APPLICABLE` discriminator itself | `LOST` where the same cell otherwise reads `NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| `pc2-broken-control-O2` | names a control whose wipe *is* removable | `control.held: false`, `VG-PROP-003`, `completesTheCheck: false` |
| `pc3-missing-subject-O2` | names a subject that is not in the unit | `NOT_OBSERVED` — never `ABSENT`, never a pass |
| `pc4-wrong-symbol-O2` | configures the oracle against a symbol nothing calls | `ABSENT` subject **and** `control.held: false` |

`pc4` is the one that matters most in practice: an oracle pointed at the wrong
symbol reads every unit as clean, and the only thing that catches it is the
control failing at the same time.

`check-matrix.py` also re-derives every record's `evidenceDigest` from
`interfaces.md` §5 in Python, independently of the C++ that wrote it, checks
that no absolute path appears anywhere in any record, and then alters a record
to confirm the digest check can fail.

## The second channel: what the source declared

Everything above re-derives the property **from the code**. The metadata channel
does the opposite: it reads **what the source declared**, and never counts a call
site or a store. Keeping both is a deliberate dual representation, and it exists
for one sentence — **metadata disappearing is not the same event as processing
disappearing.** Either can go without the other, and one channel cannot tell you
which happened.

The carrier was measured before it was used. `__attribute__((annotate("...")))`
reaches IR with **no Clang plugin loaded** (clang-18 18.1.3, `-O0` through
`-O3`), in exactly two forms, and both are read:

| carrier | form in IR | measured durability |
|---|---|---|
| on a function | an entry in the appending global `@llvm.global.annotations` | survives every `-O` level tried |
| on a local variable | a `llvm.var.annotation` call in the function | survives unless the code it sits in is deleted |

`!annotation` instruction metadata was looked for in optimised output and was
**not** found (`opt-18 -passes=annotation2metadata` left the probe module
unchanged), so no reader for it is written. An unexercised reader would be a
claim the measurement does not support.

### The four cells, and why they need their own words

The six states of `interfaces.md` §3 are the *structural* channel's answers: they
describe what the code does. Spelling "the annotation went missing" as `LOST`
would put a word meaning *the program stopped doing the thing* on an event where
the program still does it. So the vocabularies are disjoint — checked by `grep`
before the names were chosen, and re-checked by `check-dual-channel.py` on every
run, because a `grep` stops being a guarantee once the code can emit strings.

| metadata | structure | state |
|---|---|---|
| present | present | `BOTH_CHANNELS_SURVIVED` |
| **absent** | **present** | **`ANNOTATION_ERASED_EFFECT_SURVIVED`** — §10.4's case. Not a loss: the program still wipes, and only the evidence that it was asked to has gone. |
| present | absent | `ANNOTATION_SURVIVED_EFFECT_ERASED` — the metadata now asserts something the code no longer does. A metadata-only checker calls this clean. |
| absent | absent | `BOTH_CHANNELS_ERASED` |

Four more states exist so that table is only entered when it means something:
`CHANNELS_NOT_OBSERVED`, `ANNOTATION_NOT_DECLARED`, `EFFECT_NOT_ESTABLISHED`,
`SUBJECT_UNIT_ABSENT_AT_POST`. Without the second of those, a fixture compiled
with no annotations at all would report the headline state by default — the
metadata channel's version of reading "we did not look" as "it is not there".

`verdict.state` is **not** touched by any of this. The metadata channel is a
second reading, not a second vote, and `check-dual-channel.py` fails the run if
changing only `OBS_ANNOTATION_PREFIX` moves `verdict.state`.

### Running it

```sh
bash    compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/run-dual-channel.sh    # produces records
python3 compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/check-dual-channel.py  # grades them; 0 / 2 / 3
```

Its own lab (`~/vg-lab/llvm-pass-dual`) and its own plugin build
(`~/vg-build/llvm-pass-dualchannel`), so it cannot overwrite the optimisation
matrix's records.

### Measured: all four cells, from one fixture file

`red_subject`'s annotation sits inside a block the optimiser proves unreachable
and deletes; its wipe is on the live path and survives.

```
cell                     unit scope                         verdict   meta   struct
dual-red-O0              BOTH_CHANNELS_SURVIVED             PRESENT   1->1   2->2
dual-red-O2              ANNOTATION_ERASED_EFFECT_SURVIVED  PRESENT   1->0   2->1
dual-both-survive-O2     BOTH_CHANNELS_SURVIVED             PRESENT   1->1   1->1
dual-metadata-lies-O2    ANNOTATION_SURVIVED_EFFECT_ERASED  LOST      1->1   1->0
dual-both-erased-O2      BOTH_CHANNELS_ERASED               LOST      1->0   2->0
dual-wrong-prefix-O2     ANNOTATION_NOT_DECLARED            PRESENT   0->0   2->1
dual-no-annotation-O2    ANNOTATION_NOT_DECLARED            PRESENT   0->0   2->1
```

The `-O0` row is the load-bearing one: without it, `-O2` reading zero would not
be evidence that anything was *removed*. And `dual-red-O2` is the whole point —
the annotation is gone, the wipe is still there, and `verdict.state` is
`PRESENT`. A checker that watched only the declaration would have reported a
deleted wipe against a program that wipes.

### What the annotation carrier turned out to be, measured

Two results that were not expected and are recorded because they constrain what
this channel can claim. Both are reproducible — `bash
compiler/llvm-pass/tools/probe-annotation-carrier.sh` prints the tables below
and decides nothing:

**Annotations are not inert; they change what the optimiser emits.** One
attribute apart, same file, `-O2`: with `annotate` on a `static` function that is
inlined into its only caller, the function is **still there** afterwards (2
definitions, 2 `memset` sites); without it, the function is inlined and deleted
(1 definition, 1 `memset` site). The entry in `@llvm.global.annotations` counts
as a use. So a declaration is also a pin, and "annotate everything" is not a free
measurement.

**Consequently, `ANNOTATION_ERASED_EFFECT_SURVIVED` was hard to produce, and one
obvious route to it does not exist.** A function-level annotation was not
erasable in the middle end in any shape tried — including a `static` function
inlined away, which the annotation itself keeps alive. `llvm.var.annotation` is
`memory(inaccessiblemem: readwrite)`, so it is not dead-code-eliminated either:
an annotated local that is *never touched at all* still has its annotation, and
its `alloca`, at `-O2`. The one mechanism that did produce the cell is the one in
the fixture: **the annotation is code, and code the optimiser proves unreachable
takes its annotations with it, while an effect elsewhere in the unit survives.**
That is a real mechanism and it is demonstrated, but it is one mechanism, not a
survey.

At **module** scope in the same records the erasure is only partial —
`localAnnotations` 2 → 0 while `functionAnnotations` 3 → 3 — which is why unit
scope and module scope are both recorded and neither is derived from the other.

## Configuration

Six names are fixed by `interfaces.md` §0:

| | |
|---|---|
| `OBS_TARGET_FN` | subject IR unit |
| `OBS_CONTROL_FN` | control IR unit |
| `OBS_EFFECT_SYMBOLS` | comma separated |
| `OBS_OUT` | record path |
| `OBS_SNAPSHOT_DIR` | where IR is dropped at each count change |
| `OBS_REQUIRE_LIVE_BRANCH` | `1` to demand a live conditional branch |

Six more were needed and are **not** added to `interfaces.md` from here —
that file says a component needing an unlisted shape reports it instead. They
are `OBS_EXTRACTOR`, `OBS_FORBIDDEN_SYMBOLS`, `OBS_PROPERTY_ID`,
`OBS_FIXTURE_REL`, `OBS_DISABLE_MEMOBJ_DISCRIMINATOR` and
`OBS_ANNOTATION_PREFIX`. The first five are listed under
`interfaceExtensionsRequested` in `compiler/schema/properties.json`;
`OBS_ANNOTATION_PREFIX` is **not** yet, because `compiler/schema/` is another
component's tree — it is reported here and the entry is a follow-up.

`OBS_ANNOTATION_PREFIX` (default `vg:property:`) selects which annotation
strings the metadata channel counts. Pointing it at a vocabulary nothing carries
is that channel's own wrong-symbol control, and `dual-wrong-prefix-O2` fails the
run if doing so stops changing what is counted.

## What this component does not do

- It stops at the end of the IR optimiser. At `-O1` this fixture's wipe survives
  every checkpoint here and is dropped later; that is a scope limit, and
  `erasure-O1` records `PRESENT` for exactly that reason.
- It reads no object file, no link, and no command line. Every `must-not-appear`
  property is therefore at most partial, and the `must-originate-from`,
  `must-be-configured` and `must-remain-unobservable` kinds have no
  implementation at all. `compiler/schema/properties.json` says so per property
  rather than leaving it to be inferred.
- It counts no indirect call. `getCalledFunction()` returns null for one, so a
  wipe or a deny path reached through a function pointer reads as absent — a
  visible false positive rather than silence, which is the direction chosen
  everywhere an unknown had to be resolved.
- The metadata channel is read at the two endpoints only. There is no
  pass-by-pass history for it, so `dualChannel` can say *that* an annotation went
  but never *which pass took it* — `passHistory` and `firstZeroTransition` are
  the structural channel's alone. The record says so rather than leaving the
  asymmetry to be noticed.
- `ANNOTATION_ERASED_EFFECT_SURVIVED` is demonstrated by one mechanism
  (unreachable-code elimination removing the block an annotation lives in). Two
  other routes to it were tried and **do not exist** in the middle end — see the
  measured note above. No claim is made about how often the cell occurs in real
  code.

## The ladder: what exposure a build actually compiles under

The fallback lookup keys a measured envelope by a nominal six-axis config key
(`cc`, `freestanding`, `lto`, `ndebug`, `opt`, `target`). Run this driver's own
`normalise` and `driverConfigAxes` over `-O2`, over `-O2 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`,
over `-O2 -fno-builtin-memset` and over `-O2 -ffast-math` and the same key comes
back for all four — so a cell measured under one is quoted for the others.

The ladder is a small graded specimen compiled *separately* under the real
build's own flags. Which of its rungs survived is a measured index of what that
invocation's optimiser does to property-shaped code, and two builds whose
frontiers differ are two exposures whichever key they share.

```sh
bash    compiler/llvm-pass/tools/make-ladder.sh              # writes the specimen
bash    compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/run-ladder.sh O2 -O2      # one exposure, twelve observations
python3 compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/build-ladder-frontier.py  # assembles; grades nothing
python3 compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/check-ladder.py           # grades health; 0 / 2 / 3
```

Same split as `run-matrix.sh` / `check-matrix.py`: the runner decides nothing,
the assembler grades nothing, and comparing two frontiers belongs to neither —
that is `compiler/envelope/frontier-match.mjs`. Its own lab
(`~/vg-lab/llvm-pass-ladder`), and no new C++: the twelve rungs are configured
through the `OBS_*` names the observer already reads.

**It never fills or chooses a cell.** A ladder reading is a measurement of the
ladder, not of the user's program, so it can refuse a quotation and nothing
else. Measured limits, clang 18.1.3 on 2026-08-17: `-O2`, `-O3` and `-Os` are
indistinguishable to these rungs, and so are `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` and `=3` — what
is separated is fortification on from off. A command line carrying an LTO token
is refused at measurement time rather than measured, because the observer does
not reach the LTO backend.
