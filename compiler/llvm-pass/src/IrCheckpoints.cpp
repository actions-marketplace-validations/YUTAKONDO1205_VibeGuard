// IrCheckpoints -- the pre-optimisation and post-optimisation observers.
//
// Two checkpoints, one question: was the effect a declared security property
// depends on still there at the end of the optimiser, and if it was not, which
// of the two very different reasons applies.
//
//   LOST            the effect is gone and the thing it acted on is still here.
//   NOT_APPLICABLE  the representation changed, so the question no longer has
//                   the same referent -- the buffer was promoted out of memory,
//                   or the unit was inlined away and deleted.
//
// Collapsing those two into one verdict is how this kind of checker turns into
// a false-positive generator: at -O2 a great many buffers stop being buffers,
// and reporting each of them as a removed wipe would bury the one case where a
// wipe really was deleted. So the decision below is made from a structural fact
// about the object the effect acted on, not from the effect count alone -- the
// count trajectory is identical (1 -> 0) in both fixtures that demonstrate it.
//
// Configuration is by environment variable, with the names fixed in
// compiler/schema/interfaces.md section 0:
//
//   OBS_TARGET_FN            subject IR unit (required)
//   OBS_CONTROL_FN           control IR unit, whose effect cannot be removed (required)
//   OBS_EFFECT_SYMBOLS       comma separated (required)
//   OBS_OUT                  record path (required)
//   OBS_SNAPSHOT_DIR         where to drop IR at each count change (optional)
//   OBS_REQUIRE_LIVE_BRANCH  1 to demand a live conditional branch (optional)
//
// and four names this component needed that interfaces.md does not yet list.
// They are reported rather than added there unilaterally:
//
//   OBS_EXTRACTOR            ir.wipe-effect | ir.guarded-call | ir.forbidden-callee
//   OBS_FORBIDDEN_SYMBOLS    comma separated, for ir.forbidden-callee
//   OBS_PROPERTY_ID          id from compiler/schema/properties.json
//   OBS_FIXTURE_REL          source path relative to the fixture root
//
// and one that exists only to be a positive control -- it switches off the
// discriminator this file is about, so that a fixture which should read
// NOT_APPLICABLE can be shown to read LOST when the discriminator is removed:
//
//   OBS_DISABLE_MEMOBJ_DISCRIMINATOR
//
// and one more for the second representation §10.4 asks for -- the metadata
// channel, which reads the `annotate` declarations rather than the code:
//
//   OBS_ANNOTATION_PREFIX    annotation strings counted by the metadata
//                            channel must start with this; default
//                            "vg:property:". Setting it to a vocabulary
//                            nothing carries is the metadata channel's own
//                            wrong-symbol control.
