# The security configuration envelope: every cell, across the axes a build
# actually varies, including the cells whose job is to fail.
#
# Run from anywhere:
#   bash compiler/llvm-pass/scripts/run-envelope.sh
#
# Reads:   $IRCK_ENV_LAB/fixtures (written here by make-fixtures.sh and
#          envelope-fixtures.sh)
# Writes:  $IRCK_ENV_LAB (default ~/vg-lab/llvm-pass-envelope)
# Decides: nothing. build-envelope.py assembles the envelope and
#          check-envelope.py grades it, so the thing that produces the number is
#          not the thing that grades it.
#
# This script is one stage of four and leaves cells, not a result. To get from
# cells to the fragility score in one go, run the driver instead:
#
#   node compiler/envelope/envelope-pipeline.mjs
#
# It runs this file, then build-envelope.py, then check-envelope.py, then
# compiler/envelope/fragility.mjs, stopping at the first non-zero. The grading
# and the scoring stay outside this file for the reason above; the driver only
# decides the order and what to do with the exit codes.
#
# Why a second lab rather than more cells in run-matrix.sh: the optimisation
# matrix is a graded artefact with a published expectation for every cell, and a
# sweep that writes into its records directory can only make that grade less
# trustworthy. Nothing here can touch it.
#
# The axes:
#
#   opt           -O0 -O1 -O2 -O3      already in the matrix
#   ndebug        off | on             a -D, not an optimisation level
#   lto           none | full-prelink | thin-prelink | full-backend | thin-backend
#   target        host | arm-none-eabi | aarch64-none-elf
#   freestanding  off | on             see the note on the confound below
#
# freestanding is an axis rather than a fixed flag because it is a confound for
# the target axis. -ffreestanding stops the compiler treating memset as a
# builtin, which alone changes the erasure verdict on an unchanged target -- so a
# cross-target cell that carried -ffreestanding while its host counterpart did
# not would attribute a flag's effect to a processor. The sweep therefore holds
# freestanding fixed within the target comparison and varies it separately, and
# check-envelope.py refuses a target claim drawn across cells that differ in it.
