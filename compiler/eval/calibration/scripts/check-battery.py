"""Hold each cell's reading against the battery's known true value.

    python3 check-battery.py [report.json | directory ...]

With no arguments, $VG_CAL_LAB/_results/calibration is graded.

This is the only file in the directory that opens claims/expected.json. The thing
that produces a reading does not hold the answers, and the thing that assembles a
document does not decide whether it is right; both of those are separate files and
the seam is the reason a reading can be graded at all.

WHAT IS GRADED, AND WHY EACH ONE IS AN INVARIANT RATHER THAN A READING

  * A REFERENCE cell reads its known true value. That is what makes it a reference
    cell. A disagreement is a defect in the extractor, and it is exit 2 -- a
    positive finding about the instrument, not an average to be taken over cells.

  * An INSTRUMENT-LIMIT PROBE is NOT graded here. Its true value and its expected
    reading differ on purpose, and the expected READING lives in
    claims/degradation-claims.json, which check-claims.py reads. Grading a probe
    here would either fail it for behaving exactly as documented, or -- worse --
    quietly promote its misreading into a true value. Both readings are printed
    and neither moves the exit code.

  * Section 3.1's PAIRING RULE holds on every cell: a cell whose measurement is
    not OK carries state NOT_OBSERVED and controlHeld null. This is a check on the
    ASSEMBLER rather than on the extractor, and it is here because the raw records
    do not obey the rule (an observer record carries verdict.state = LOST beside a
    fallen control) and build-battery-report.py is the only thing standing between
    that word and a reader.

  * A known-BROKEN cell reports BROKEN_MEASUREMENT where expected.json says so and
    OK where it does not. Both directions, and the second is the load-bearing one:
    a cell that reported a broken apparatus at every configuration would be
    indistinguishable from a harness that always says so.

  * Every cell in the report has an expectation, and every expectation matches a
    cell. A silently uncovered cell reads as a passing cell.

  * The document hashes to the digest it carries. This is a PRECONDITION, not one
    grade among several: grading a document that cannot be trusted is exactly "we
    did not look" reported as a finding.

WHAT IS NOT GRADED HERE

Whether the catalogue's degradationRisk prose agrees with the measurement. That is
check-claims.py, and it is a different question -- "is the instrument right" versus
"does the tracked description of the instrument's weaknesses match what the
instrument does" -- with a different failure meaning. A single file grading both
would let one of them go green behind the other.

NOT ESTABLISHED

Sixteen cells agreeing is also what a switched-off grader reports. So when the
whole set graded contains no BROKEN_MEASUREMENT at all, the result is printed as
NOT ESTABLISHED rather than as a pass: the apparatus column has never been seen to
fire, and the negative-controls doctrine in this tree says a run whose negatives
are clean and whose paired positive control is also clean is not a pass. That is
not an error, so it does not by itself change the exit code -- it changes what the
last line says, which is what a reader takes away.

EXIT CODES (interfaces.md section 7)
  0  every invariant held on every document read
  2  an invariant was falsified. A reference cell misread its true value, or the
     pairing rule was broken.
  3  a document could not be read or graded: missing, wrong schema, a digest that
     does not recompute, a cell with no expectation, or an expectDefinedInAsm
     declaration that disagrees with the listing in EITHER direction.

2 outranks 3 when both are present, and both are printed. A falsified invariant is
a positive finding; an ungradeable cell is an absence, and reporting the absence in
its place would hide the finding.
