"""Experiment 1: hold the catalogue's degradation prose against what was measured.

    python3 check-claims.py [report.json | directory ...]

With no arguments, $VG_CAL_LAB/_results/calibration is read.

THE QUESTION THIS FILE ASKS, AND WHY IT IS NOT check-battery.py's

check-battery.py asks "is the instrument right", by holding a reading against a
known true value. This file asks a different question with a different failure
meaning: "does the tracked English description of the instrument's weaknesses match
what the instrument actually does". compiler/schema/properties.json carries, for
each extractor, a `degradationRisk` list of sentences saying how it degrades and in
which direction it errs. Those sentences are quoted by other documents and are read
as fact. Until this file existed, none of them had ever been held against a
measurement.

A single grader doing both jobs would let one go green behind the other, which is
why there are two files and why this one RUNS NO COMPILER: it reads assembled
reports and the catalogue, and nothing else.

THE COVERAGE FENCE

The sentence list is recomputed from properties.json and held VERBATIM against
claims/degradation-claims.json. A sentence with no entry, or an entry whose copy of
a sentence has drifted from the catalogue, is exit 3 under the word
`claims-coverage-broken`. That fence is the whole honesty mechanism: without it a
maintainer could test the convenient sentences and leave the awkward ones
unmentioned, and the ledger would look complete. With it, an untested sentence has
to be entered WITH A REASON, and editing properties.json forces the ledger to move
in the same commit.

Its SCOPE is the degradationRisk arrays of the three implemented extractor entries.
The per-property arrays elsewhere in properties.json are not fenced by this
revision, and the ledger says so rather than leaving a reader to assume otherwise.

HOW A DISAGREEMENT IS TO BE READ

Exit 2, and it is a finding either way -- the prose is wrong about the code, or the
code is wrong and the prose described the intent. This file does not decide which,
because deciding it needs a reading of the extractor's source and that is a
different act from measuring. What it must never do is resolve the tension by
adjusting the ledger: that is the failure
compiler/eval/negative-controls/README.md names, where the fixture goes green and
the instrument stays exactly as broken, behind a tick.

An OMISSION is exit 2 for the same reason: a measured divergence that no sentence
in the fenced scope describes means the catalogue is not a complete description of
the instrument. The resolution is an amendment to properties.json, and this
directory deliberately does not make it -- a battery that edits the catalogue it is
calibrating in the same change has stopped being an independent measurement.

FAILURE DIRECTION

Fails towards reporting a finding rather than towards silence. Every path that
cannot decide something leaves exit 3 and names what could not be decided; a claim
whose fixture is missing from the report is `claim-unreadable`, never
`claim-agrees`. The one direction it deliberately does NOT protect against is a
sentence that is vague enough to be unfalsifiable: `scope` claims are recorded and
never graded, so a maintainer could in principle evade this file by writing prose
that predicts nothing. That is a real hole and the ledger's claimKind column is
where it is visible.

EXIT CODES (interfaces.md section 7)
  0  every measured claim agreed with the measurement, and nothing is omitted
  2  a claim disagreed, a doctrine failed, or an omission is open
  3  the fence is broken, or a claim could not be read at all

2 outranks 3 when both are present, and both are printed.
