"""Corrupt assembled calibration reports and assert that check-battery.py refuses each.

    python3 falsify-battery.py [--keep]

A grader that has never been shown to FAIL has not been shown to work. This
directory demonstrated its refusals once, by hand, in a session whose output has
scrolled away -- which is exactly the asymmetry the metamorphic lane next door does
not have, because it ships scripts/falsify-meta.py. This is the missing half.

WHAT IT IS NOT

Not a measurement, and it compiles nothing. It reads the reports already in
$VG_CAL_LAB/_results/calibration, writes corrupted copies into a scratch directory,
and runs the real grader on them. If there are no reports it exits 3 rather than
reporting success over an empty set: a falsifier with nothing to falsify is the same
empty-scan failure every check in this tree is written against.

EVERY CORRUPTION RE-DIGESTS unless the digest IS the point. Otherwise each one would
be caught by the digest precondition and nothing below it would ever be exercised --
the test would pass while testing one thing ten times.

WHAT EACH CORRUPTION IS FOR, AND WHY ITS CODE IS ITS CODE

Exit 2 is a positive finding about the instrument or the document; exit 3 is a check
that could not be completed. The pairing that matters is which side each corruption
lands on, because a grader that reported them all the same way would be telling a
reader "something is wrong" and nothing more:

  reference-state-flipped        2  a reference cell misread its known true value
  pairing-rule-broken           2  a state word on a cell whose measurement is not OK
  control-held-null-when-fell   2  a fallen control described as one nobody ran
  role-laundered                2  a reference cell relabelled a probe, which is how
                                   its state would stop being graded at all
  lane-claims-measured          2  the dominance lane claiming it measured something
  digest-staled                 3  the document cannot be trusted, so nothing in it is
  dominance-lane-deleted        3  a declared absence removed from the document
  cell-dropped                  3  an expectation with no cell to hold it against
  toolchain-removed             3  section 5's block missing: readings unattributable
  frame-declaration-broken      3  the witness disagrees with what expected.json
                                   declares, in either direction
  configuration-missing         3  half a battery swept and reported as a whole one

EXIT CODES (interfaces.md section 7)
  0  every corruption was refused with the code it is contracted to produce
  2  a corruption was NOT refused, or was refused with the wrong code. That is a
     finding about the grader, not about the corruption.
  3  there was nothing to corrupt, or the scratch directory could not be made.
