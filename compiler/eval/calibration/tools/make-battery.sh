#
# WHAT THIS IS
#
# A calibration battery in the metrological sense: a set of reference specimens
# whose true value is established BEFORE any probe is pointed at them, so that a
# probe can be qualified by being made to read them rather than by having its
# error model argued from its source. This script is the standard. The specimens
# are its output and are never committed -- interfaces.md section 1, and the same
# rule tools/make-ladder.sh is written under: a fixture committed under compiler/
# is a measurement input in the published tree.
#
# Because the specimens are not committed, THIS SCRIPT is what a reviewer reads,
# and its sha-256 is what pins the standard. scripts/run-battery.sh recomputes
# that digest and refuses to measure when it has moved without battery.json's
# `generatorSha256` moving with it: a generator that changed is a different
# standard, and a standard that can change silently is not one.
#
# WHAT A "TRUE VALUE" MEANS HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE PROBE'S OWN READING
#
# Every specimen below is written so that its state is decided by something other
# than the extractor being calibrated. Three channels, and every fixture names
# which of them it stands on (claims/expected.json, field `truthArgument`):
#
#   construction   the C language forbids the other readings. A wipe whose zeros
#                  are subsequently read cannot be removed by a conforming
#                  compiler, so PRESENT is not a hope about the optimiser.
#   asm-witness    compiler/eval/second-vendor/lib/asm-oracle.mjs, at the `asm`
#                  checkpoint, which is a DIFFERENT instrument at a DIFFERENT
#                  point. It is coarser -- it cannot tell LOST from
#                  NOT_APPLICABLE and has no pass attribution -- and it is used
#                  only where that coarseness does not matter.
#   defined-fns    the function names this script reads back out of the bytes it
#                  just emitted. "This name is not in the emitted file" is a fact
#                  about the file and is independent of every extractor.
#
# A fixture standing on `construction` ALONE is a single-legged truth. Those are
# marked as such in expected.json and scripts/check-battery.py reports them
# separately, because a battery that presented a one-legged truth as a two-legged
# one would be overstating its own authority.
#
# SIZE DISCIPLINE
#
# One fixture, one translation unit. The memory-object discriminator decides LOST
# from NOT_APPLICABLE by an alloca-size census within a unit, so two objects of one
# size interact with the verdict. Keeping one fixture per unit keeps that
# interaction out of the fixtures that are not measuring it -- as far as the SOURCE
# can, which is not all the way.
#
# ★ THE DISCIPLINE IS NOT SUFFICIENT, and this paragraph used to say it was.
# Measured 2026-08-17: a probe with ONE 192-byte alloca at pre-opt, promoted away,
# plus a static helper holding its own 192-byte local, reads post sizes [192] and a
# false LOST. Inlining brought a same-sized object into the unit that no
# source-level size hygiene could have predicted. Distinct sizes lower the chance of
# a census collision; they do not remove it, and a fixture whose verdict depends on
# that census should be read knowing so.
#
# Sizes are pairwise-distinct primes drawn from a band DISJOINT from the ladder's
# (the ladder uses 59..103): 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157,
# 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193. Disjoint so that a specimen of this battery and a rung
# of the ladder can never be confused by size in a record read out of context.
#
# THREE fixtures deliberately break the size discipline, and each says so in its own
# comment: cw_samesize (two objects of one size, which is the arrangement the
# catalogue used to name); cw_inlinesize (one object of that size in the source and a
# second arriving by inlining, which is the arrangement that actually defeats the
# census); and cw_napp (199 bytes, chosen ABOVE the 128-byte x86-64 red zone so that
# a surviving in-memory object requires a visible stack adjustment -- that is what
# makes its NOT_APPLICABLE readable from the assembly instead of from the
# discriminator under test).
#
# OUTPUT
#
# key=value on stdout, in the shape observe-config.sh's manifests already use:
#
#   lab=<the lab root the specimens were written into>
#   fixture=<id>:<path to the emitted translation unit>
#   fn=<id>:<one function name that fixture's emitted bytes define>   (repeated)
#
# The fn lines are DERIVED from the emitted bytes, never kept beside them. A list
# kept by hand can be right about a file that has changed, and the failure it
# would let through is the observer's third silent mode: a subject name that
# resolves to nothing gives rc 0, empty stderr, a non-empty log and a held
# control, with only the subject's rows missing.

#
# Here the real wipe is dead and goes, while `flag`'s zero store survives because
# its address is read. The subject's effect count therefore stays at one and the
# cell reads PRESENT while the property is LOST. That is the DANGEROUS direction
# for a must-survive property: the reading says the defence is there.
#

# SHAPE 4 of 4 -- dominance. THERE IS NO EXTRACTOR FOR THIS SHAPE.
#
# compiler/schema/properties.json, property survive.input-validation:
# `extractor: null`, and its controlRule says outright that a control for a
# dominance property is not the same shape as a control for a count. So these two
# specimens are emitted and never measured, and the report carries the lane with a
# status word rather than omitting it.
#
# They are here because a calibration standard that pre-dates its probe is the
# metrologically correct order: whoever writes the dominance extractor has to make
# it read a set it did not choose. A battery assembled afterwards by the same hand
# that wrote the probe would be that probe'"'"'s own homework.

# Read the names back out of the bytes that were just written.
#
# Same predicate as tools/make-ladder.sh: a name followed by a parameter list with
# no nested parentheses and then an opening brace. Every definition above
# satisfies that on one line or on the line the brace opens; the declarations in
# the preamble end in `;` and the call sites inside bodies are followed by `;` or
# by another `)`, so neither can be mistaken for a definition.
#
# An empty list for any fixture is refused here rather than downstream, because an
# empty list makes every name check pass vacuously -- which is the whole failure
# this output exists to prevent.
