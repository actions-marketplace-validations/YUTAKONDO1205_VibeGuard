// The runner: read a project, build the index, run the cross-file rules, and
// hand back findings in the shape the CLI can merge into an ordinary scan.
//
// WHY THIS DEPENDS ON @vibeguard/analyzer-core
//
// It would be easy to walk the directory here with a private ignore list, and it
// would be wrong. The CLI runs the core engine and this pass over the SAME
// target, and their outputs land in one report. If the two disagree about which
// files exist — because one honours `DEFAULT_IGNORE` and the other reimplements
// it, or because one maps `.mjs` to JavaScript and the other does not — then a
// cross-file finding can cite a file the core scan never opened, or miss a
// handler the core scan reported on. That inconsistency would be invisible in
// testing and infuriating in use.
//
// So the ignore set and the language mapping come from `analyzer-core`, which
// owns them. The dependency direction is the safe one: this package may know
// about core, and core must never know about this package — that asymmetry is
// what keeps the extensions free of cross-file code, and it is asserted by
// `scripts/check-packaging-invariants.mjs` rather than left to discipline.

/**
 * Apply the config `suppress` channel to cross-file findings.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL PLUMBING
 *
 * Without it, a team that writes `{"suppress":[{"paths":["src/legacy/**"],
 * "rules":["VG-SMELL-010"]}]}` watches the finding come back on every run. The
 * whole "precision contract plus an escape hatch" design of this project rests
 * on the hatch existing; a rule that cannot be silenced is a rule that gets
 * turned off wholesale, and for a design smell emitted at `high` under the
 * default `--fail-on high` gate, "turned off wholesale" means the CI job is
 * either red forever or the flag is removed. Neither is a supported outcome.
 *
 * The suppression decision is made against the PRIMARY location, not against
 * every related one, and that choice needs stating because it is the one place
 * a `project`-scoped finding does not fit the per-file model the config was
 * written for. A cross-file finding implicates several files; asking "is it
 * suppressed" for each of them yields several answers with no principled way to
 * combine them:
 *
 *  - ANY match suppresses  → one ignored legacy file silences a finding whose
 *    other four sites are in live code. Too weak.
 *  - ALL must match        → a finding is unsuppressable unless every site is
 *    covered, so the natural request ("stop telling me about the legacy area")
 *    fails whenever the smell straddles the boundary. Too strong to be usable.
 *
 * The primary location is where the finding is FILED — it is what `filePath`
 * says, what a reviewer clicks, and what a `baseline` keys on. Suppressing by it
 * means the config question is asked of the same path the rest of the pipeline
 * already treats as the finding's home, so the answer is predictable from what
 * the user sees. Findings whose primary site is outside the glob still appear,
 * which is the conservative direction.
 *
 * The severity gate is NOT re-implemented here: `evaluatePathSuppression` is the
 * same function the core path calls, so a blanket wildcard is refused for
 * security-judgement severities in exactly the same way and by exactly the same
 * code. Duplicating that policy for this channel is how the two drift.
