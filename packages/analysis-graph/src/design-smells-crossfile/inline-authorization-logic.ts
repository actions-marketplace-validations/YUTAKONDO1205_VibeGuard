// VG-SMELL-013 — Inline Authorization Logic (implementation plan §5.4, appendix
// B's 0.3.0-β cross-file block).
//
// WHAT IT CLAIMS
//
// The project has an authorization guard. It is written, it is exported, and it
// is mounted on several routes — the convention exists and the team follows it.
// And then one file's handlers make the same class of decision by hand, in the
// handler body, refusing the request themselves instead of letting the guard
// refuse it. The policy now lives in two places that cannot be changed together:
// widening `requireRole('admin')` to `requireRole('admin', 'owner')` fixes every
// route that uses the guard and silently misses the handler that re-derived it.
//
// This is the shape VG-SMELL-010's labelling rubric calls 二重化 (duplication)
// and explicitly labels a true positive for 010 when 010's thresholds are met:
// "ガードが存在してハンドラにも適用済みなのにインラインでも判定している場合は
// 「二重化」であり、TP でよい（policy が1箇所に無いという主張は依然成立する）"
// (`docs/smell010-labeling-rubric.md`, §1 D). 013 is the rule for the case where
// those thresholds are NOT met — one file, one or two handlers — and where the
// existence of the guard is what makes a single site accusable at all.
//
// ★ WHY THIS IS A CROSS-FILE RULE, THOUGH THE SPEC SAYS 「単一/cross-file」
//
// The design notes list 013 as both single-file and cross-file. It is
// implemented HERE, in the cross-file package, and the sentence is read as
// "detected with single-file vocabulary, adjudicated on cross-file evidence".
// Three reasons, all of them already settled elsewhere in this repository rather
// than argued afresh:
//
//  - `scattered-authorization.ts`'s own header states that the single-file
//    design-smell rules 003 / 012 / 004 deliberately do NOT report a lone inline
//    check, and that "a finding that a single file could have produced does not
//    get to use" this package's justification. A single-file 013 would flag
//    `if (user.role !== 'admin') return res.status(403)` — one of the most
//    common correct lines in web programming — and would contradict a precision
//    decision this project has already made and shipped.
//  - The only evidence that makes 013 precise is "a role guard already exists
//    and is used", and that is cross-file by construction: the guard is in
//    `middleware/`, the handler is in `controllers/`, and the mounting is in
//    `routes/`. No single file contains the sentence.
//  - Single-file rules ship inside the Chrome and VS Code bundles, where the
//    input can be a pasted textarea fragment with no project around it. A rule
//    whose premise is "your project already centralised this" cannot evaluate
//    its premise there, and a premise that cannot be evaluated is a premise that
//    gets assumed.
//
// ★★ THE NEGATIVE CONDITION THAT DECIDES WHETHER THIS RULE IS SHIPPABLE
//
// LAYERED authentication plus inline authorization is CORRECT, and it is the
// default architecture of most Express applications: `authenticate` mounted
// globally so every request has a principal, and the privilege decision written
// in the handler where the resource id is finally known. A rule that fires on
// that is not slightly noisy — it is wrong about the majority of correct code,
// which is worse than the VG-SMELL-041 regression this directory's registry
// records (041's false positives were rare; this shape is everywhere).
//
// That is precisely why `authz-lexicon.ts` splits `AUTHN_GUARD_WORD` from
// `AUTHZ_GUARD_WORD`, and its comment names this rule as the reason. Condition
// (a) below therefore requires `isAuthzGuardName()`: a project whose only
// mounted guard is `authenticate` / `requireLogin` / `verifyToken` produces
// NOTHING here, ever. `samples/crossfile-fixtures/smell-013-neg-authn-only` is
// that fixture, it was written before the positive one, and it is the first test
// in the suite.
//
// ★ HOW THE REST OF THE PRECISION IS BOUGHT — negatives before positives
//
// 010 can afford a loose per-site test because it needs three sites across two
// files before it speaks; the arithmetic of "three independent coincidences" is
// itself evidence. 013 speaks about ONE handler, so each site has to carry the
// weight alone. Four conditions do that, and each one is a fixture:
//
//  1. THE RECEIVER MUST NAME A SUBJECT. `req.user.role`, `session.user.role`,
//     `claims.role` are privilege reads; `m.role`, `element.role`, `node.role`,
//     `row.role` are not. See `SUBJECT_WORD`.
//  2. THE CHECK MUST REFUSE. A 401/403, or a Forbidden/Unauthorized error,
//     within `DENIAL_WINDOW` characters after the check. Branching on privilege
//     to shape a response (`if (user.role === 'admin') return allRows(); return
//     ownRows();`) is not a re-implementation of a guard and is not reported.
//     See `DENIAL_WINDOW`.
//  3. NO OWNERSHIP DECISION IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. `doc.ownerId !== req.user.id
//     && !req.user.isAdmin` is a per-resource decision that no route-level guard
//     could have made, because it needs the loaded resource. See
//     `IDENTITY_COMPARISON`.
//  4. A METHOD CALL IS DELEGATION, NOT AN INLINE CHECK. `auth.isAdmin(user)` is
//     the shape this rule recommends. Byte-identical to the exclusion
//     `scattered-authorization.ts`'s `checksIn` already implements.
//
// ★★ MEASURED 2026-08-03, BEFORE SUBMISSION — where a real repository leaves
//
// `design-smells-crossfile/index.ts` records that a green suite is not evidence,
// and that both β taint rules were rejected after a corpus sweep. So this rule
// was swept before it was submitted, over BOTH corpora, and the funnel was
// instrumented rather than only the outcome — a zero-finding sweep says nothing
// at all unless you can say which condition emptied it.
//

//
// Zero findings, zero crashes, zero errored repositories. What that establishes
// and what it does not, stated as plainly as the registry states it for 041 and
// 052: the rule does not fire on 2,683 repositories nobody here wrote, which is
// what `samples/safe == 0` generalises. It establishes NOTHING about recall — no
// true positive was produced either, so the only evidence of usefulness is this
// rule's own fixtures.
//
// ⚠ THE TWO MARKED corpus1k CELLS WERE CORRECTED 2026-08-03. They previously
// read 6 and 2. Those were counted over ALL languages including test paths; the
// rule itself is TS/JS-only and drops `isTestPath` files, and applying its own
// filters gives 4 and 1. The distinction matters here more than the arithmetic
// does: `rohitg00__agentmemory`, named below as a project (a³) refused, does not
// actually survive to (a²) under the rule's filters — its `BM25_SCOPE` mounts
// exist only in `test/index-persistence.test.ts`. A funnel measured more loosely
// than the rule attributes refusals to the wrong condition, which is the exact
// error VG-SMELL-011's registry note also made. Count premises THROUGH the
// rule's own predicates or the funnel argues for something else.
//
// The funnel is the useful part, and two rows in it are worth reading twice:
//
//  - (a¹) → (a²) → (a³) IS THE RULE. Only 23 of 877 TS/JS repositories in the
//    AI-generated corpus mount anything with an authorization NAME at all. That
//    single number is why this rule is safe and also why it is quiet: the
//    premise it needs is rare in real code, and every project that lacks it —
//    including every `authenticate`-only project, which is the majority — is
//    unreachable by construction rather than by a threshold.
//    ⚠ IN corpus1k, "rare" is the wrong word — the honest word is UNREACHABLE.
//    The decision point was reached 0 times in 1,000 human-written
//    repositories, and both arms fail for structural reasons rather than
//    threshold ones: Next.js `pages/api` endpoints emit no route registration,
//    so (a) cannot form, and their `const handler = withX(..., async (req,res)
//    => {…})` arrows are not indexed as symbols, so (b) cannot form — of 569
//    authorization-shaped decisions in that corpus, exactly 1 lay inside an
//    indexed handler body. LAION-AI/Open-Assistant carries this rule's target
//    shape (a `withAnyRole` convention over 11 endpoints, one of which
//    re-derives the role inline and returns 403) and is invisible to both arms.
//    Adding fixtures does not move this; extending the route/handler model does.
//  - THE ONE PROJECT WITH BOTH is `webaz-protocol__webaz`: `requireAgentGrantScope`
//    mounted on 23 routes, and thirteen inline decisions in thirteen route files.
//    VG-SMELL-010 fires there and 013 defers, which is the disjointness clause
//    doing what it was written for, on real code, once.
//    ⚠ This used to say VG-SMELL-010 fires there "correctly". That word is
//    withdrawn: the only support for it is the entry in
//    `paper_data/smell010_labels.json`, whose own `labeledBy` field reads
//    "AI-prepared draft, NOT human-reviewed" and whose `humanConfirmed` is
//    false — and `paper_data/` is gitignored, so a reader of this repository
//    cannot see that caveat. What is observable here is that 010 spoke and 013
//    deferred. Whether 010 was right is unadjudicated. The registry's old
//    "spot-checked, real cycles" line was wrong in exactly this way (two of
//    those nine findings were false), so this is a known failure mode of this
//    codebase, not a hypothetical one.
//
// ★ THE TWO PROJECTS THAT (a³) REFUSED, AND WHY THE CONDITION IS NOT OPTIONAL
//
//  - `rohitg00__agentmemory` mounts `scope` and `BM25_SCOPE`. Both satisfy
//    `isAuthzGuardName` — `scope` is a word in `AUTHZ_GUARD_WORD` — and neither
//    is a guard; they are ordinary identifiers that landed in a pre-handler
//    argument position of something the route pattern matched. Requiring the
//    definition to RESOLVE is what refused them, so a bare lexicon word cannot
//    on its own manufacture this rule's premise.
//  - `sahat__hackathon-starter` mounts `isAuthorized` on 7 routes and
//    `authorize` on 4 — a genuine, textbook convention — and (a³) refused it
//    too, because the guards are written `passportConfig.isAuthorized` and the
//    indexer keeps only the last segment while the import binds `passportConfig`.
//    That is a REAL recall miss and it is the price of the previous bullet. It
//    cost nothing here (that project has no inline decision either), and the fix
//    is in the indexer's handling of namespace imports, not in loosening this.
//
// ★ WHAT THIS RULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT USE
//
// `isPublicByDesignRoute()` from the lexicon is NOT consulted. 011 needs it
// because its accusation ("this route has no guard") is false by construction on
// a login endpoint. 013's accusation is "the decision written here already has a
// home elsewhere", which is equally true on a public route, and the offending
// handler is usually in a different file from its registration so the path is
// frequently unavailable anyway. Skipping it is a smaller claim, not a laxer one.

 * How many route registrations must name the guard before it is a CONVENTION.
 *
 * Three, matching the "three or more occurrences" shape VG-SMELL-010 takes from
 * design addendum §7.2, and for the mirror-image reason. 010 needs three sites
 * before scattering is a pattern rather than a coincidence; 013 needs three
 * mounts before centralisation is a pattern rather than one route that happened
 * to get a guard. At two the accusation collapses into a matter of taste — a
 * project with `requireAdmin` on two routes and an inline check on a third has
 * not obviously established anything, and telling it that it broke its own
 * convention is telling it about a convention it does not have.
 *
 * Counted as distinct REGISTRATIONS (`filePath` + line), not distinct paths and
 * not distinct files. `router.get('/a', requireAdmin, h)` and
 * `router.delete('/a/:id', requireAdmin, h)` are two decisions to use the guard
 * even though they concern one resource, and two files each mounting it once is
 * the same evidence as one file mounting it twice. What is being counted is how
 * many times somebody chose the guard.

 *
 * ★ THE REFUSAL REQUIREMENT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 * THIS RULE AND VG-SMELL-010, AND IT IS WHAT MAKES A ONE-SITE FINDING HONEST.
 *
 * Consider the code this rule must never report:
 *
 *     export function listReports(req, res) {
 *       if (req.user.role === 'admin') return res.json(allReports());
 *       return res.json(reportsFor(req.user.id));

 *
 * Every positive condition holds — a privilege property, a subject receiver, a
 * registered handler, a guard convention elsewhere in the project — and the code
 * is correct and unremarkable. It BRANCHES on privilege; it does not decide
 * admission. A route-level guard could not replace it, because the guard's only
 * vocabulary is "continue" or "refuse" and this handler wants neither.
 *
 * What 013 accuses is the handler that duplicates the guard's own verb: it
 * refuses. So a 401/403 or a Forbidden/Unauthorized error is REQUIRED, and it
 * has to be close enough that the two are plainly one statement.
 *
 * 400 characters, forward only. Forward because a refusal is the consequence of
 * the check and consequences follow; both `if (bad) return res.status(403)` and
 * `const bad = user.role !== 'admin'; if (bad) return res.status(403)` read
 * forwards. 400 rather than "the enclosing block" because this package has no
 * parser and reconstructing the block from braces here would duplicate
 * `extractBlockAfter` at a granularity it was not written for; 400 characters is
 * four or five lines of formatted TypeScript, which is a refusing `if` with room
 * to log first, and past that the two statements stop obviously belonging to
 * each other. Erring long costs precision, erring short costs recall, and this
 * is the one window where the number is a judgement rather than a measurement —
 * it is written down so a corpus pass can argue with it.

 *     }
 *
 * `!req.user.isAdmin` is a privilege flag on a subject receiver, it refuses, the

 * condition holds and the code is RIGHT: the decision needs `doc`, which does
 * not exist until the handler runs, so no route-level guard can make it. The

 *
 * The discriminator is the identity comparison sitting next to it, so the

 * term and the privilege term are routinely on different lines of one `if`.
 *

 *
 * ★ THE `isOwner` TRAP, AND WHICH SIDE OF IT THIS RULE CHOSE.
 *
 * `AUTHZ_PROPERTY` in the lexicon contains `isOwner`/`is_owner`, so the FLAG
 * pattern matches both `if (!user.isOwner)` — a boolean privilege flag on the
 * subject, which is exactly what this rule is about — and the identity shape
 * above. THE PRIVILEGE FLAG IS KEPT. The exclusion is written against the
 * id-vs-id COMPARISON (`IDENTITY_COMPARISON`), never against the property name,
 * because dropping `isOwner` from the vocabulary would be divergence from the
 * shared lexicon of exactly the kind that made VG-SMELL-041 fail — and it would
 * discard the true case in order to avoid a false one that a more specific test
 * already catches. `if (!doc.isOwner)` is excluded too, but by `SUBJECT_WORD`
 * rather than here: `doc` does not name a subject.

 * neither mentioning the other — so this file asks the different question.
 *
 * Requiring the receiver to NAME a subject subsumes the blocklist and is

 * documents as attacker-controlled and semantically the opposite of a principal

/**
 * Every authorization guard this project has adopted as a convention.

 * in the order they are cheapest to refuse:
 *
 *  1. The name is an AUTHORIZATION guard name (`isAuthzGuardName`), not an
 *     authentication one. This is the condition the whole rule stands on; see
 *     the file header and `AUTHN_GUARD_WORD` in the lexicon.
 *  2. It appears in the middleware position of at least `MIN_GUARDED_ROUTES`
 *     route registrations, outside test paths.
 *  3. Its definition resolves through the import graph to a file in this
 *     project, and every mount agrees on which file that is.
 *  4. The symbol table also judges the definition to be a guard.
 *
 * ★ (3) IS NOT PLUMBING — IT IS WHAT STOPS A BARE LEXICON WORD FROM BECOMING A
 * PREMISE, and the corpus is why it is written down here rather than treated as
 * an implementation detail. `rohitg00__agentmemory` in `paper_data/corpus1k`
 * puts `scope` and `BM25_SCOPE` in a pre-handler argument position four and six
 * times. `scope` is a word in `AUTHZ_GUARD_WORD`, so `isAuthzGuardName` says yes
 * and conditions (1) and (2) both hold on a project that has no guard at all.
 * Requiring the name to resolve to a definition in this repository is the only
 * thing that refused it. The full funnel is in the file header.
 *
 * ★ WHY (4) IS HERE EVEN THOUGH IT IS NEARLY ALWAYS IMPLIED.
 *
 * `buildSymbolTable` admits a name as a guard wherever it is known once it has
 * been used as middleware anywhere, so (2) very nearly implies (4). It is
 * checked anyway because the two are answers to different questions — "was this
 * mounted" versus "does the project's symbol table call this a checkpoint" — and
 * a future change to either producer that made them disagree should make this
 * rule go quiet rather than silently start reasoning from a fact that is no
 * longer true. The cost is one set lookup.
 *
 * ★ WHAT IS KNOWN TO BE MISSED, stated rather than discovered later.
 *
 * `app.use(requireAdmin)` and `router.use('/admin', requireAdmin)` do NOT count.
 * The structure indexer puts the last argument of a registration in the HANDLER
 * position, so a guard mounted with no handler after it never reaches
 * `middlewareNames` — `linkRouteHandlers` compensates by promoting it to the
 * `middleware` ROLE, but the count this function needs is not recoverable from
 * that. A project that mounts its authorization guard globally therefore
 * produces no findings here. That is the quiet direction and it is a real miss:
 * global mounting is arguably the strongest possible form of the convention this
 * rule wants to see. Fixing it means teaching `RouteBinding` to distinguish
 * "mounted alone" from "registered as a handler", which is an indexer change and
 * belongs to whoever needs it, not to a rule working around it.
