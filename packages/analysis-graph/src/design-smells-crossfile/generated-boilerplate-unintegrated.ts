// vibeguard:disable-file VG-AUTH-002
// The doc comment below quotes `// TODO: mount validateInput` as the EXAMPLE of
// the unmounted-guard shape this rule detects. VG-AUTH-002 reads that quotation
// as a real unimplemented auth check. Naming the one rule rather than
// wildcarding, same as the other rule sources in this directory.
// VG-SMELL-052 — Generated Boilerplate Without Integration.
//
// WHAT IT CLAIMS
//
// A security-purpose function was written — a validator, a sanitizer, an
// authentication or authorization guard — it was exported so that something else
// could use it, and nothing in the project ever names it. Meanwhile the routing
// layer is live: there are registrations that mount no guard at all, and
// attacker-controlled data demonstrably reaches a sink inside a registered
// handler. The protection exists in the repository and is not in the request
// path.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE AI FAILURE MODE AND NOT AN ORDINARY DEAD-CODE REPORT
//
// Ask a model for "an endpoint that accepts comments, with input validation" and
// it produces two artefacts: the endpoint, and `validateInput`. Both are correct.
// The one line that joins them — adding `validateInput` to the argument list of
// `app.post` — is a third artefact, it is boring, and it is the one that gets
// dropped, because nothing in either file looks incomplete without it. The
// resulting repository passes every review that reads code rather than wiring:
// the validator is present, exported, and even unit-tested, and the endpoint it
// was written for is unprotected.
//
// This is precisely why the finding must NOT be phrased as "unused export".
// Every project has unused exports and almost none of them are security defects.
// What makes this one a security defect is the conjunction with the request
// path, and the request path is what the rule is required to observe rather than
// assume.
//
// ★ WHY TAINT IS A REQUIREMENT AND NOT AN ORNAMENT
//
// The implementation plan is explicit that 041 and 052 must rest on taint
// evidence rather than a structural heuristic (§5.3, §5.4, and the risk table
// entry "041/052 は taint 根拠必須"). The temptation is to satisfy that on paper
// by printing a flow next to a finding that was decided structurally. This rule
// makes the flow a FIRING CONDITION: with no taint flow reaching a sink inside a
// registered route handler, there is no finding, whatever the rest of the
// structure looks like. `samples/crossfile-fixtures/smell-052-neg-no-untrusted-
// input/` is the fixture that holds that line — an unwired, exported, correctly
// named validator, unguarded routes, and total silence, because nothing in that
// service reads anything a client controls.
//
// The reason to want it that way is not compliance with a plan. It is that
// "exported function nobody calls" is a maintainability observation, and the
// difference between that and a security finding is entirely whether untrusted
// data is flowing past the place the protection should have stood. Taint is the
// only thing in this package that can answer that question with a path a
// reviewer can check line by line instead of a heuristic they have to trust.
//
// ★ HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM VG-AISC-003, WHICH MAKES A SIMILAR-LOOKING JUDGEMENT
//
// `unintegrated-security-init.ts` also reports "generated, and never wired up",
// and half of its mechanism (count identifier occurrences over blanked project
// text; zero occurrences outside the definition means nobody named it) is the
// same idea. The two are deliberately not merged, and the differences are not
// cosmetic:
//
//   - LANGUAGE. That rule is C/C++ only; this one is TS/JS only. The two
//     populations are disjoint by construction, enforced through `languages`, so
//     no file can produce both findings.
//   - WHAT MAKES IT MATTER. There, the evidence that the initializer was meant
//     to be called is a DECLARATION IN A PROJECT HEADER — a static fact about
//     intent. Here it is a live TAINT FLOW — a dynamic fact about consequence. C
//     firmware has no route table to point at; a web service has no header to
//     point at.
//   - WHERE THE MISSING LINE GOES. There the remediation is "call it from your
//     start-up path". Here it is "add it to the argument list of a registration",
//     and the finding cites the specific registrations where it would have gone.
//   - EXPORT SHAPES. C export is `static` or not. JS has four spellings
//     (`export function`, `export const`, `export { … }`, `module.exports = { … }`)
//     and two of them put the symbol's name in the file a SECOND time, which a
//     naive occurrence count reads as a use. That machinery has no C analogue.
//
// The shared half is roughly twenty lines of regex counting, and the version
// here has to carry export-surface and self-recursion exclusions the C version
// has no concept of. Two callers asking different questions, not one abstraction
// waiting to be extracted.
//
// ★ THE ERROR DIRECTION IS REVERSED FROM EVERY OTHER RULE IN THIS DIRECTORY, AND
//   THAT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE EDITING IT
//
// VG-SMELL-010 fires on the PRESENCE of code, so anything that widens its view
// can only cost recall; the symbol table's deliberate over-admission of guards
// (`checkStock` is judged a guard, on purpose — see `isGuardShapedName`) is safe
// there because an over-admitted guard silences a finding.
//
// This rule fires on the ABSENCE of a reference. Every heuristic that admits one
// extra name, and every file the reference scan is not allowed to read, produces
// a FALSE POSITIVE on correct code. So:
//
//   - the vocabulary below is written from scratch and narrower than
//     `inferRoles`, because inheriting a vocabulary tuned for over-admission
//     would inherit `checkStock` and `ensureDirectory` as security boilerplate;
//   - the reference scan reads the ENTIRE project including the test tree, which
//     is the opposite of what VG-SMELL-010's `TEST_PATH` does, for the reason
//     spelled out on `TEST_PATH` below;
//   - every judgement is an under-approximation: a mention this analysis cannot
//     see makes the finding vanish, never appear.
//
// ★ MEASURED CORRECTION — WHAT THE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS RULE GOT WRONG
//
// The paragraph above states the safety argument. The first implementation did
// not actually satisfy it, and an adversarial review found three ways in, each
// reproduced on a real input rather than argued from the source. They are
// recorded here rather than quietly repaired because every one of them is a
// mistake the next author will be tempted to make again, and because two of the
// three were already contradicted by comments elsewhere in this same file — a
// comment claiming a property is not the property.
//
//  1. NO LOCALITY. The three firing conditions were each computed over the WHOLE
//     scan root, so an unreferenced helper in one package, an unguarded route in
//     a second, and a taint flow in a third satisfied the conjunction between
//     them. In a monorepo that is a retired module being convicted by a live
//     service it has never been part of. The old comment "Drop (4) and the rule
//     degenerates into a dead-code report wearing a CWE" was true and the rule
//     was in that state, because condition (4) was being supplied by unrelated
//     code. `APP UNITS` below is the repair.
//
//  2. `export *` DEFEATED THE REFERENCE SCAN. `security/index.ts` writing
//     `export * from './require-admin'`, with `app.ts` doing
//     `import * as guards from './security'` and mounting `Object.values(guards)`,
//     is a construction in which EVERY guard is necessarily mounted — and the
//     confidence comment below asserted that with no inbound import "no namespace
//     object, re-export, or computed lookup can reach the symbol". That assertion
//     was checked against `fanIn`, and `export *` produces no import edge at all
//     (the indexer's `JS_IMPORT` requires the `import` keyword), so `fanIn` was 0
//     and the correctly-mounted guard was reported at `high`. `MODULE_HANDLE` is
//     the repair, and it silences rather than downgrades: a module somebody else
//     holds whole is a module whose symbols this analysis cannot claim to have
//     counted.
//
//  3. `app.use(require('./security/require-auth'))` WAS READ AS "NOBODY USES IT".
//     Mounting a module wholesale never spells the symbol's name, so a purely
//     lexical scan cannot see it — and the rule had the import graph in its hand
//     the entire time and consulted it only for a confidence band. Same repair as
//     (2); the CJS arm additionally has to tell `const { requireAuth } = require(x)`
//     (a named binding, which the lexical scan CAN see) from
//     `const requireAuth = require(x)` and from an inline `require` with no
//     binding at all (both whole-module handles, which it cannot).
//
// ★ APP UNITS: what "the same application" means here, and why not the obvious
//   alternatives
//
// Locality needs a unit, and the unit has to be inferable from source alone —
// this package never reads `package.json`, because `collectProjectFiles` admits
// only files in languages the indexer understands and a manifest is not one of
// them. Three candidates were considered:
//
//   - DIRECTORY DEPTH ("the evidence must share N leading path segments").
//     Rejected: it is a guess about someone else's layout. `middleware/x.ts` and
//     `app.ts` share zero segments and are the same program; `packages/api/**`
//     and `packages/legacy/**` share one and are not.
//   - A CONVENTIONAL CONTAINER LIST (`packages/`, `apps/`, `services/`, …).
//     Rejected as the primary mechanism: it works exactly as far as the list
//     does, and a repository laid out as `frontend/` + `backend/` — which needs
//     no convention to be obviously two products — is not on it.
//   - THE IMPORT GRAPH'S CONNECTED COMPONENTS, which is what is implemented.
//     A component is a set of files that actually reach each other, which is the
//     closest thing to "one program" available without a build system.
//
// The candidate itself is usually NOT in the component — that is the whole
// premise of the finding — so component membership cannot be asked of it
// directly. What is asked instead is whether it sits in the component's
// TERRITORY: the union of the directory subtrees that directly contain a file of
// that component. An unmounted validator in `middleware/` is inside the
// territory of an app whose `request-logger.ts` lives in `middleware/`; a helper
// in `packages/legacy/src/` is not inside the territory of an app whose files
// are all under `packages/api/src/`.
//
// The consequence worth stating in advance, because it looks like a bug the
// first time it is seen: when an application's entry point sits at the scan root
// its territory is the whole tree, and locality stops constraining anything.
// That is correct rather than a hole — a repository whose `app.ts` is at the top
// level IS one application, and every file below it is its territory.

 *  - `encrypt` / `hash` / `sign` / `mask`. A crypto helper genuinely can be

 *    own evidence would not apply to it. The rule cites ROUTE REGISTRATIONS as

 *     subtract it concludes that every symbol exported at the bottom of its file

 * Whether anything in the project names this symbol.

 * Counts whole-word occurrences over BLANKED text project-wide, so a mention in

 * the same conservative reading VG-AISC-003 takes, and for the same reason: a
 * comment is not a call, and treating it as one would suppress a real finding.
 *
 * In the DEFINING file, three kinds of occurrence are not uses and are subtracted:
 *
 *  - the declaration head itself, which every symbol has exactly once. Rather
 *    than locating it by offset arithmetic against `startLine`/`startColumn`,
 *    the test is "more than one occurrence survives", which is the same
 *    statement with nothing to get wrong;
 *  - occurrences inside the symbol's OWN BODY, which is recursion. A validator
 *    that calls itself has not been wired to anything;
 *  - occurrences inside an export surface. See `EXPORT_SURFACE`.
 *
 * In every OTHER file, ANY occurrence counts as a reference — including a bare
 * `import { validateInput } from './validators'` with no call, and including
 * anything under the test tree. Both are deliberate under-approximations: an
 * import with no call is arguably still this smell, and this rule declines to
 * make that claim because a lexical scan cannot distinguish it from a call the
 * pattern did not recognise.
 *
 * ★ WHAT THIS FUNCTION IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE ASKED ON ITS OWN.
 *
 * Its answer is "no file spelled the name", and the first implementation read
 * that as "no file uses it". The two differ for every import form that does not
 * spell names — a re-export chain, a namespace object, a whole-module `require`
 * — and the difference was two of the three defects this rule shipped with. The
 * caller must therefore consult `opaquelyHeldFiles` FIRST and decline the
 * candidate outright; there is no occurrence count that recovers the answer
 * afterwards.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ Module handles: the forms in which another file holds a module WHOLE
//
// The reference scan above asks "does any file spell this symbol's name". That
// question has an answer only for the import forms that name what they take.
// Five forms do not, and each of them hands the importing file the module
// itself rather than a binding out of it:
//
//   export * from './x'          the barrel; nothing is named, everything passes
//   import * as ns from './x'    a namespace object; `ns[k]` reaches any export
//   import x from './x'          the default binding — which may BE the candidate
//   import './x'                 side-effect only; the module registers itself
//   require('./x')               undestructured, including inline as an argument
//
// A file reached by any of these is a file whose symbols this analysis has not
// counted, and the rule's whole safety argument is that it under-claims. So the
// response is SILENCE on every candidate defined in such a file, not a lowered
// confidence: `low` is still a finding, and a finding that says "this guard is
// not mounted" about `app.use(require('./security/require-auth'))` is wrong
// rather than uncertain.
//
// ★ WHY THIS IS NOT READ OFF `StructureIndex.imports`
//
// The import edges are already built, already resolved, and carry a `names`
// array — the obvious move is to call an edge opaque when `names` is empty. It
// does not work, and the reason is worth recording so it is not re-attempted:
// `bindingNames` in the indexer flattens all three ESM shapes onto the same
// output. `import * as ns from './x'` yields `['ns']`, `import def from './x'`
// yields `['def']`, and `import { def } from './x'` also yields `['def']`. The
// distinction this needs is exactly the one that array has already discarded, so
// the syntax has to be re-read. `export *` is worse than ambiguous there: it
// produces no edge at all, which is the defect that shipped.
//
// The specifier is read from the ORIGINAL content at the matched offsets, not
// from the blanked copy, because a specifier IS a string literal and the blanked
// copy holds spaces where its characters were. Blanking is length-preserving, so
// the offsets transfer — the same property `structure-indexer` relies on.
// Resolution goes through `resolveSpecifier`, the dependency graph's own
// resolver, so an edge this rule follows and an edge the graph drew agree by
// construction rather than by two implementations happening to match.

 * which is every `.get(` in the language. Running the rule over
 * `smell-052-neg-all-routes-guarded/security/require-admin.ts` produced a

 * `authorization`. `map.get(key)`, `cache.get(id)` and `headers.get(name)` all
 * parse the same way, and `map.get(key)` in particular comes out with an empty
 * middleware list and `key` in the handler slot, which is byte-for-byte the
 * shape of an unguarded endpoint.
 *
 * That matters here more than it does anywhere else in this package, because
 * "an unguarded registration exists" is a PERMISSIVE condition: a spurious one
 * makes the rule more willing to fire, and it would be cited in the finding as
 * the place the validator should have gone. So a registration has to look like
 * an HTTP endpoint before it counts as one, and an Express path literal begins
 * with `/` (or is the catch-all `*`). `map.get(key)` has no literal first
 * argument at all and `req.get('authorization')` has one that is not a path.

      //     the same `enclosing`, in both its JS and its Python arm, so they

      //     `linkRouteHandlers` re-labels a method as `middleware`, which
      //     happens only when a registration NAMES it — and a named symbol is
      //     referenced, so it never arrives here. Written as one statement to
      //     say that, rather than as two that would look independently tested.
      //  2. The `exported` gate below already excludes every method. A method
      //     head never carries `export`, `JS_EXPORT` only records top-level
      //     names, and the export-surface spans cover the file's export
      //     statements — none of which a class member appears in. Constructing a
      //     counterexample means writing a file that re-exports a name its own
      //     class happens to reuse, which is not code, it is a fixture arguing
      //     with itself.
      //
      // Kept because the reasoning is entirely about what the INDEXER does
      // today. An indexer that starts marking class members exported — a
      // TypeScript `declare module` block would be the obvious way in — makes
      // this the line standing between the rule and a finding on every correctly
