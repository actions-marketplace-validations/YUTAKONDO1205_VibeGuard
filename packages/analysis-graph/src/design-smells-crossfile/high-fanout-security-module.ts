// VG-SMELL-021 — High Fan-out Security Module (implementation plan §5.4, the
// "依存グラフ" arm; appendix B lists it in the 0.3.0-β cross-file block).
//
// WHAT IT CLAIMS
//
// One module decides security — it hashes passwords, verifies tokens, or answers
// "may this subject do this" — and that module reaches out to a large share of
// the rest of the project to do it. Every one of those outgoing edges is a
// module whose behaviour the security decision now rests on: change the config
// loader, the cache, the user repository or the feature-flag service, and you
// have changed what the guard says without editing the guard. Two concrete
// consequences follow, and they are the two the plan names:
//
//  - ATTACK SURFACE. Reaching the security decision no longer requires reaching
//    the security module. Anything the security module imports is upstream of
//    it, so compromising, mocking, or merely misconfiguring any of them lands
//    inside the decision.
//  - INITIALISATION ORDER. A module with many dependencies has many things that
//    must already be ready when it runs. Security code is the code most likely
//    to run FIRST (a guard runs before the handler; a crypto init runs before
//    the subsystem), which is exactly when the fewest of its dependencies are
//    initialised. VG-AISC-003 in this same directory is the acute version of
//    that failure; this is the chronic one.
//
// WHY IT CANNOT BE A SINGLE-FILE RULE
//
// Fan-out is not a property of a file's text. `import { getUser } from
// '../repo/user'` looks identical whether it names a project module or a
// published package, and only the project's own file set decides which — the
// resolution that `dependency-graph-builder` performs. A single-file rule
// counting `import` lines would count `express`, `react` and `node:crypto` as
// fan-out and report a two-file project as a hub. The number this rule
// thresholds on exists only after the graph is built.
//
// ★ THE NUMBER COMES FROM `metrics-calculator`, NOT FROM HERE
//
// `fanMetrics` in `../metrics/index.js` is the one definition of fan-in and
// fan-out in this package, and it is called rather than reimplemented even
// though "count the resolved import edges" is three lines. VG-SMELL-010 already
// puts `fanIn` on its findings through the same function and its comment names
// this rule as the reason: two rules counting privately is how one report ends
// up carrying two different numbers both called `fanOut`. The threshold argument
// below is only meaningful if the quantity being thresholded is the quantity the
// finding reports.
//
// A consequence worth stating because it bounds what this rule can ever see:
// `fanMetrics` counts edges the graph RESOLVED, which means project-internal
// modules only. A security module that imports fifteen npm packages and no local
// file has fan-out 0 here. That is the right unit for this smell — the claim is
// about coupling to the project's own moving parts — but it is not the same
// quantity as "number of import statements", and nothing below should be read as
// if it were.
//
// ★★ WHAT "SECURITY MODULE" MEANS, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDED IT
//
// The obvious definition is the cheap one: a file whose PATH carries a security
// word (`auth/`, `permissions/`, `crypto/`, `login/`). It was measured before it
// was written, over the first 169 repositories of `paper_data/corpus1k` that
// yielded TS/JS sources (16,641 files):
//
//   files with a security path word                  623   (3.74%)
//   of those, fan-out ≥ 8                             25
//
// The twelve highest of those 25 were listed and read (the remaining thirteen,
// at fan-out 8 and 9, were not — so this is a statement about the top of the
// distribution and is written as one):
//
//   28  Gitlawb__openclaude/src/components/permissions/PermissionRequest.tsx
//   21  …/src/components/permissions/rules/PermissionRuleList.tsx
//   18  …/src/components/permissions/BashPermissionRequest/…
//   16  …/src/components/permissions/ExitPlanModePermissionRequest/…
//   15  …/src/components/tasks/RemoteSessionDetailDialog.tsx
//   14  …/src/components/ConsoleOAuthFlow.tsx
//   13  …/src/components/permissions/FilePermissionDialog/FilePermissionDialog.tsx
//   13  …/src/components/permissions/rules/AddWorkspaceDirectory.tsx
//   12  …/src/components/permissions/AskUserQuestionPermissionRequest/…      (×2)
//   10  …/src/components/permissions/AskUserQuestionPermissionRequest/QuestionView.tsx
//   10  …/src/components/permissions/MonitorPermissionRequest/…test.tsx
//
// Every one of them is a REACT COMPONENT. They are dialogs and forms that talk
// ABOUT permissions; not one of them decides anything.
// Their fan-out is high because a React screen imports its child components, and
// a rule built on the path word would have reported the whole permissions/
// directory of a UI as a concentration of security responsibility. That is the
// same class of mistake the previous wave shipped and had to withdraw, and it is
// avoidable here for free, because the question "does this module decide
// security" has a behavioural answer.
//
// So the path word does not admit anything. Membership is decided by what the
// module DOES — a call into a cryptographic primitive, a token verification, a
// password comparison, or a privilege decision, from the closed vocabularies
// below — and the path word survives only as a CONFIDENCE signal, where a
// mistaken one costs a band rather than a finding.
//
// ★ WHY `project.symbols.guards` IS NOT THE MEMBERSHIP TEST EITHER
//
// It would be the natural thing to reach for and it is deliberately not used.
// `buildSymbolTable` admits a guard when a name is `usedAsMiddleware ||
// isGuardShapedName(name) || (exported && securityPath)`, and its own comment
// explains that the over-admission is intentional: `guards` is consumed as
// EXCULPATORY evidence elsewhere (VG-SMELL-010 fires when guards are missing), so
// admitting too many costs a missed finding there. Consumed as INCULPATORY
// evidence here the same looseness costs a false positive — every exported symbol
// in `src/middleware/logging.ts` is a "guard" by that third clause. Evidence that
// is safe to over-admit in one direction is not safe to reuse in the other, and
// this is the file where that would have gone wrong.

 * in the rule's name is a description of the population rather than a wish, low

 * ★ THE SMALL-PROJECT FLOOR, EXPRESSED AS A RATIO RATHER THAN AS A FILE COUNT.
 *
 * The failure this exists to prevent is stated in the task that commissioned the
 * rule and is worth writing out: a module with fan-out 8 in a nine-file project
 * is not a hub, it IS the project. Reporting "responsibility is concentrated
 * here" about a program with nowhere else to put it is a tautology dressed as a
 * finding.
 *
 * A flat `MIN_PROJECT_FILES = 24` would express the same intent for a fan-out of
 * exactly 8 and then stop working: a module with fan-out 20 in a 25-file project
 * would clear it, and that is the most extreme version of the very shape the
 * floor was written for. Tying the floor to the finding's own number keeps the
 * statement constant — a reported module always depends on at most a third of
 * the modules that exist — so the constant means one thing at every fan-out
 * instead of meaning "eight is special".
 *
 * A third rather than a half or a quarter: at a half the claim "the rest of the
 * project is somewhere else" is barely true, and at a quarter the floor becomes
 * the binding constraint for every mid-sized service (a fan-out of 8 would
 * demand 32 modules, which is above the corpus median project of 25 TS/JS
 * files). A third leaves the absolute floor doing the work in the range where it

 * The module must be in the upper tail of ITS OWN project's fan-out.

 * ★ WHY A RELATIVE CONDITION IS PRESENT AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.
 *
 * The commissioning note suggested a threshold normalised by project size might
 * be better than a magic number. A purely relative threshold — "the top 1% of
 * this project's files" — was rejected, and the corpus says why: it fires in
 * EVERY project, including a ten-file project whose busiest module imports
 * three others, because some file is always in the top 1%. A rule whose firing
 * condition is "be the maximum" reports one finding per repository by
 * construction and measures nothing.
 *
 * What a relative condition genuinely buys is protection against HOUSE STYLE. In
 * a heavily layered application where the ordinary module imports a dozen
 * others, a security module with fan-out 10 is unremarkable and reporting it
 * would be reporting the architecture rather than a smell. So the relative test
 * is used as an additional necessary condition rather than as a replacement:
 * the module's fan-out must be strictly greater than the project's own 90th
 * percentile. In the common project — where p90 is 3 — the condition costs
 * nothing and the absolute floor decides; in the layered project it is what
 * keeps the rule quiet.
 *
 * Strictly greater, not ≥: with a percentile taken from a small sample the value
 * is frequently a tie, and `≥` would admit a module that merely equals the
 * tenth-busiest file in its project. The point of the condition is to be an
 * outlier, and equalling the boundary is the opposite of that.

 *   ChatGPTNextWeb__NextChat  app/components/exporter.tsx
 *       m.role === "user"                        ×2
 *   ChromeDevTools__chrome-devtools-mcp  src/tools/input.ts
 *       child.role === 'option'
 *       aXNode.role === 'combobox'
 *
 * Neither file decides anything. The first compares a CHAT MESSAGE role — the
 * collision `scattered-authorization.ts` already documents, and its denylist of
 * chat literals did not catch this one because the literal was `"user"`, which
 * that file deliberately leaves out (`role !== 'user'` is a real authorization
 * check). The second compares an ARIA ACCESSIBILITY role: `option`, `combobox`,
 * `textbox`, `menuitem` are a third meaning of the same property name, and one
 * that appears in every browser-automation and component library there is.
 *
 * A denylist cannot win this. Chat roles, ARIA's seventy-odd roles, database
 * enum values and form field names are four separate vocabularies that all
 * spell themselves `role`, and adding them one at a time is a losing game that
 * the ARIA list alone would make unreadable. What all of them have in common is
 * the RECEIVER: a privilege check reads the role off something that stands for a
 * person. `m`, `child` and `aXNode` do not, and no chat message or accessibility
 * node ever will.
 *
 * So the test is inverted into an allowlist, matched against the tokenised
 * receiver so `currentUser`, `req.user` and `sessionUser` all pass without being
 * listed. VG-SMELL-010 makes the opposite call — it uses a receiver DENYLIST and
 * only when no literal is available, having measured that an unconditional
 * receiver test discarded `entry.role !== 'admin'` inside a `for (const entry of
 * users)` loop. The two rules diverge here on purpose and the reason is the
 * population: that rule has already established it is looking inside a
 * registered route handler before it reads a receiver at all, and this one has
 * established nothing — the receiver is the only context it has. The cost is the
 * same recall that rule was protecting: a genuine `entry.role !== 'admin'` in a
 * loop is not counted here. A module that only ever decides authorization that
 * way, twice, and imports eight things, is a false negative this rule accepts.

 *
 * The accumulator is keyed by OFFSET, so removing the guard cannot change how
 * many operations are found — a second write to the same key overwrites rather
 * than appends. What it changes is the family LABEL when two arms match at the
 * same offset, and the guard makes that "the first arm wins" rather than "the
 * last one does". The arms that actually overlap agree: `jwt.verify(...)` is
 * recognised by the package arm and by the token-receiver arm, both as `token`,
 * and `user.permissions.includes(x)` is seen by the membership arm and by
 * `METHOD_CALL`, which does not record `includes` at all. Constructing a case
 * where the label differs takes a package whose family is one thing and whose
 * method name is in `CRYPTO_METHOD` — reachable in principle, not present in any
 * real API this vocabulary names. So the mutation is reported as surviving
 * rather than answered with a fixture invented to kill it; the guard stays
 * because "first evidence wins" is the behaviour the evidence strings describe.

 * deleted branch could have changed the verdict for are ones where a file with
 * zero declarations nevertheless performs two security operations at module
 * scope — which is a security config module, not a barrel, and suppressing it
 * would have been the wrong answer anyway.
 *
 * A branch no test can cover is a claim nobody checks. In a rule whose entire
 * risk is false positives that is worse than the redundancy it was there to

 * (`smell-021-neg-router-barrel`) and by this note instead of by a line that

/**
 * ★ WHY TypeScript/JavaScript ONLY, WHEN FAN-OUT IS LANGUAGE-NEUTRAL.
 *
 * The graph resolves Python imports and C `#include`s too, so the fan-out half
 * of this rule would work unchanged in both. The membership half would not: the
 * security-operation vocabulary above is a list of Node and browser APIs and npm
 * packages, and in a Python project it would match nothing at all. A rule that
 * cannot recognise a security module in a language will never fire in it — which
 * is silent failure, not conservatism, and it puts a language in the `languages`
 * list that the rule has no fixtures for and no ability to be quiet on
 * deliberately. `scattered-authorization.ts` records the same decision, made
 * after the same discovery, and this follows it rather than re-learning it.
 *
 * ★★ MEASURED ON REAL REPOSITORIES — `paper_data/corpus1k`, all 1,000
 * directories walked, 630 of which yielded source the graph admitted.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS BLOCK RECORDED "3 TP / 0 FP" FOR TWO WAVES AND IT WAS NOT TRUE. The
 * adjudication behind it was a SPOT CHECK — one of the three read at the source,
 * the other two accepted — and `design-smells-crossfile/index.ts` said
 * "spot-checked" while this block said "read at the source". When the remaining
 * two were read, one was false. The numbers below are the post-#35 re-run, and
 * the sentence that was wrong is left visible rather than deleted, because the
 * failure was not the false positive: it was a smaller sample described in the
 * words of a bigger one.
 *
 *   findings                       2   (was 3 before #35)
 *   repositories with a finding    2
 *   read at the source, TP/FP      2 TP / 0 FP   (of 3 adjudicated: 2 TP, 1 FP)
 *   severity                       1 high / 1 medium
 *   confidence                     1 high / 1 medium
 *
 * The two:
 *
 *   Dokploy__dokploy  packages/server/src/lib/auth.ts        fan-out 8 of 800
 *     `bcrypt.hashSync` / `bcrypt.compareSync`, reaching into the db, the
 *     schema, access-control, the auth secret, an audit log and a HubSpot
 *     tracking module. medium/high. ★ Sits ON the threshold: all eight of its
 *     resolved edges are value imports, so type erasure removes none of them.
 *     A filter one edge too aggressive would delete this true positive, which is
 *     why #35 was gated on a corpus re-run and not on a code reading.
 *   docmost__docmost  …/core/workspace/services/workspace.service.ts  15 of 1319
 *     Owner/admin enforcement — "there must be at least one workspace owner",
 *     "an admin may not act on an owner" — inside a service coupled to fifteen
 *     modules. high/medium. Its type-looking imports (`SpaceRole`, `UserRole`,
 *     `Feature`) are `enum`/`const` — values — so it too is unmoved.
 *
 * ★ AND THE ONE THAT LEFT — the false positive #35 removed:
 *
 *   whyour__qinglong  back/loaders/express.ts   reported at fan-out 9 of 165
 *     Real security code (JWT verification, API-token check, scope enforcement
 *     in the Express loader), but the fan-out was not real: `AuthInfo` is an
 *     `interface` in `back/data/system.ts` and `AppScope` is a `type` in
 *     `back/data/open.ts`, both imported without the `type` keyword and used
 *     only in type position. Seven modules can change what that decision says.
 *     The threshold is eight. See `./type-erasure.js`.
 *
 * ★ AND THE FALSE NEGATIVE THE SAME RUN PRODUCED, recorded because a precision
 * figure quoted without one is half a measurement. `whyour__qinglong`'s
 * `back/services/user.ts` signs JWTs, has fan-out 8, and is NOT reported: after
 * the property-access fix on `bareCallPattern` it has exactly one security
 * operation, and `MIN_SECURITY_OPERATIONS` is two. It is a real security module
 * and the floor is what silenced it — the trade that floor exists to make,
 * paid here in a case where it was not worth paying. Two operations stays,
 * because the alternative measured worse: the same fix that cost this finding is
 * what removed two thirds of the evidence lines from the one above it.
 *
 * The four shapes earlier drafts reported and no longer do — React permission
 * dialogs, chat-message roles, ARIA roles and the browser's `Notification.
 * permission` — are each pinned by a test rather than by this note.
