// vibeguard:disable-file VG-INJ-006 reason="the `el.innerHTML = escapeHtml(name)` occurrences are PROSE inside this file's own doc comment, written to explain why the sink span stops at the first `(` — quoting a correctly-sanitised assignment in order to explain a false positive is not an unsafe assignment; same self-scan exemption class as scripts/sec-transfer-semgrep.mjs"
// VG-SMELL-041 — Temporal Security Coupling. The first rule in this package
// whose evidence is a DATAFLOW rather than a shape.
//
// WHAT IT CLAIMS
//
// A security operation the code already contains does not protect the value it
// was written for, because of ORDER. Two orders can be wrong, and this rule
// reports both:
//
//   INVERTED — the operation runs after the sink. `db.query(sql)` on line 9 and
//   `escapeLike(term)` on line 11: the statement has already executed, and the
//   escaping cannot have protected anything.
//
//   BYPASSED — the operation runs first, and its result is not what reached the
//   sink. `const safe = sanitizeFilename(raw)` on line 20 and
//   `fs.createReadStream(join(dir, raw))` on line 22: the page order is right
//   and the DATA order is not.
//
// The premise both share is what makes this a design smell rather than an
// injection report: the function demonstrably knows the value needs handling —
// it handles it, ten lines away — and nothing in the structure of the code makes
// the handling apply. That is a coupling between two statements that only the
// author's memory maintains, which is the definition of a temporal coupling and
// the reason the fix is structural rather than a one-line patch.
//
// ★ WHY THE DEFINITION IS TAINT-SHAPED AND NOT TEXT-SHAPED
//
// The design notes name the failure of the obvious version outright: today
// 041 "can only say that a `save` comes after a `validate` in the text, which is
// a false-positive source", and taint makes it evidence — "the argument of
// `save` is a tainted variable that does not pass through `validate`". A
// statement-order rule reports every handler that happens to call a validator
// late for an unrelated value, and reports nothing about whether the value at
// the sink is the checked one. Both halves of that are fixed by asking the
// question of a FLOW: which value, from where, through what.
//
// ★ THE THREE OTHER NATURAL DEFINITIONS, AND WHY NONE OF THEM IS THIS ONE
//
//  1. "A tainted value reaches a sink." That is injection, and `VG-INJ-004` /
//     `VG-INJ-006` already report it from the single-file engine on every one of
//     the four channels. Emitting it again here would put a second, design-smell
//     shaped copy of the same defect in the same report, under a category that
//     promises structural evidence it would not have. `smell-041-no-sanitizer/`
//     is the fixture that pins the boundary: a raw flow with no security
//     operation anywhere near it is not this rule's finding.
//
//  2. "A guard clause sits after the sink" — `res.send(row); if (!req.user)
//     return res.sendStatus(401);`. Refused because deciding it needs control
//     flow this layer does not have. Whether a guard protects a sink is a
//     question about DOMINANCE, not about offsets: an early return in one branch
//     legitimately follows a response written in another, and a lexical pass
//     cannot tell the two apart. Getting it wrong would fire on ordinary
//     multi-branch handlers, which is the failure mode this package treats as a
//     bug rather than a near miss.
//
//  3. "The function contains a sanitizer and a tainted flow." Refused: it fires
//     on any handler that validates an email address and also queries a
//     database. The sanitizer's ARGUMENT has to name a value on the flow's own
//     chain, which is what turns "a security operation exists nearby" into "a
//     security operation was written FOR THIS VALUE and did not apply to it".
//
// ★ WHY A TRANSFORMER AND A VALIDATOR ARE NOT THE SAME CALL
//
// This is the distinction the rule is built around, and getting it wrong is how
// the obvious implementation produces its worst false positive.
//
//   A TRANSFORMER (`escapeHtml`, `sanitizeFilename`, `encodeURIComponent`)
//   returns a SAFE COPY. Correct use requires the copy to be the value that
//   reaches the sink, so "the flow did not pass through it" is a real defect.
//
//   A VALIDATOR (`isValidHostname`, `validateTicketId`, `verifySignature`)
//   returns a VERDICT. It produces no new value, so the value reaching the sink
//   is BY CONSTRUCTION the same variable that was checked and no hop of the
//   chain can ever carry the validator's name. Reporting "the flow did not pass
//   through the validator" would therefore report every validate-then-use
//   handler in existence — the most common correct shape there is.
//
// So a validator can only be reported INVERTED (a check after the use is wrong
// under any control flow), and a validator positioned before the sink SILENCES
// the finding entirely. `smell-041-validate-first/` is that fixture.
//
// What that concession costs, stated rather than hidden: the rule cannot tell
// whether the failing branch short-circuits, so `if (!isValid(x)) log('bad');`
// followed by the sink is a FALSE NEGATIVE. Recovering it needs the same
// dominance analysis definition 2 was refused for.
//
// ★ WHY THIS RULE LIVES IN `analysis-graph` DESPITE NOT BEING CROSS-FILE
//
// It is not cross-file and does not claim to be — `hops` never leaves one
// function body, and the finding's `scope` is `symbol`. It is here because H1
// taint is here, and H1 is here because it cannot be anywhere else: the core
// engine's `RuleDefinition` takes one string and returns spans within it, which
// is the property that lets the same rule set run inside the Chrome extension
// over a textarea. A dataflow pass needs symbol bodies, so it needs the indexer,
// so it belongs on this side of the package boundary. The `cross-file` tag is
// deliberately NOT on this rule's findings for the same reason: it would claim
// evidence the finding does not have.
//
// ★★ MEASURED 2026-08-02 — THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS RULE SCORED PRECISION 0 ON
// REAL CODE, AND FOUR CONDITIONS ARE WHAT IT WAS MISSING
//
// Everything above this line was true of the rule as first written, and the rule
// as first written was wrong. Run over the 1,000 repositories in
// `paper_data/corpus1k` (777 seconds, every repository scanned, nothing sampled)
// it produced THREE findings and not one of them was a defect. All three are
// reproduced as negative fixtures in this group, because a rule whose only
// contact with real code was a false positive has to carry that contact in its
// corpus or the next edit reintroduces it.
//
// What went wrong, and what each failure bought:
//
//  1. TWO STATEMENTS THAT CANNOT BOTH RUN. `decolua__9router` writes
//     `if (isAdmin()) { fs.readFileSync(hostsFile) } else { … quotePs(hostsFile) … }`,
//     and the rule reported the `else` branch's call as "runs after the sink" —
//     twice. The INVERTED test was a comparison of two offsets, and an offset
//     comparison cannot tell "later on the same path" from "in the branch that
//     did not run". That is EXACTLY the failure definition 2 above was refused
//     for, arriving through a door nobody was watching: it was kept out of the
//     guard-clause reading and let straight into the sanitizer reading.
//
//     The fix is `sameBlock`. There is no CFG here, so the question "could these
//     two statements both execute, in this order" is not answerable; the question
//     "do these two statements sit in ONE brace block" is, from the blanked text,
//     and it is a strict under-approximation of the first. A guard in a sibling
//     branch is now unreportable, and so is a guard nested one level deeper —
//     recall this rule no longer has, stated rather than discovered.
//
//  2. A PARAMETERISED STATEMENT IS NOT A MIS-ORDERED ONE.
//     `const rows = await db.query('… WHERE id = $1', [id]); res.send(escapeHtml(id))`
//     is the ordinary correct Express shape — a placeholder for the database, an
//     HTML escape for the page — and the first version fired on it whichever
//     order the two lines were written in. Worse, the shape it fired on is the
//     one this rule's own `remediation.exampleFix` recommends.
//
//     The mistake was treating H1's flow as evidence that the value ARRIVED
//     unprotected. It is not: H1 reports a flow into `db.query` because `id`
//     appears in the argument list, and it has no opinion about whether it
//     appears as a bound parameter. `sinkIsParameterized` asks that question
//     directly, and it can answer it because blanking is length-preserving — a
//     `$1` that is a space in `StructureIndex.blanked` and a `$1` in the original
//     was inside a string literal, i.e. it is part of the statement rather than
//     part of the code.
//
//  3. A VOCABULARY WIDE ENOUGH TO CATCH `stripTrailingWhitespace`. See the
//     ★ MEASURED CORRECTION on `VALIDATOR_WORDS` — the claim written there was
//     falsified, not refined.
//
//  4. A GUARD WRITTEN FOR A DIFFERENT PROPERTY OF THE SAME OBJECT.
//     `JimLiu__baoyu-skills` reads `options` out of `process.argv`, opens
//     `options.changelogFile`, and later calls `validateSkillMetadataVersion(…,
//     options.version)`. Both mention `options`, so the premise "written for THIS
//     value" was satisfied by two statements about two different values. A hop
//     that names an OBJECT cannot carry the premise, and `mentionsBare` is the
//     narrowing: a chain name mentioned as `name.property` names a property, and
//     only a chain name mentioned as a bare token names the value that flowed.
//     Applied to the sink as well as to the guard, which is what closes it — the
//     sink there consumes `options.changelogFile`, never `options`.
//
// ★ WHY THE SOURCE'S POSITION IS NOT PART OF THE BLOCK TEST
//
// The obvious extension of `sameBlock` is to demand all three cited points —
// source, sink, guard — in one block. It is not done, and the reason is that the
// source's position cannot distinguish the failure the test exists for. Failure 1
// is entirely about whether the GUARD could have run on the path the SINK ran on;
// a source assigned inside a conditional (`if (a) { t = req.query.a } else { t =
// req.query.b }`) is on every path that reaches either, and demanding it share
// the sink's block would delete that shape for no precision gained. A condition
// added for symmetry rather than for a measured failure is a condition nobody can
// falsify.
//
// KNOWN GAPS, so nobody has to discover them by being wrong. Every one of them
// fails toward SILENCE, which is the direction a design smell has to fail in:
//   - Everything H1 cannot see, this cannot see. No property writes, no
//     interprocedural flow, no compound assignment. See `taint/index.ts`.
//   - A sanitizer whose name is not in the vocabulary below is invisible.
//   - A guard in a sibling branch, or nested deeper than the sink, is not
//     reported even when it really is dead protection. See `sameBlock`.
//   - A value consumed by the sink as `object.property` is not reported at all.
//     See `mentionsBare`.
//   - ★ MEASURED LIMIT, found by a mutation that would not die: a call written
//     as the DIRECT first argument of another call is invisible to
//     `guardCallsIn`. `CALL_RE` opens with `(?:^|[^\w$.])` and therefore CONSUMES
//     the `(` of the outer call, leaving the inner callee with no boundary
//     character to match against — so `db.query(escapeSql(x))` collects
//     `db.query` and not `escapeSql`. It is fail-safe in both directions that
//     matter (an unseen guard establishes no premise, so the shape is silent
//     either way, and the same shape is what `inSink` would have suppressed),
//     which is why it is recorded rather than repaired here: widening `CALL_RE`
//     would newly admit every nested call in the corpus as a candidate guard,
//     and that is a precision change to be measured on its own rather than
//     smuggled in beside four false-positive fixes.
//     `smell-041-inline-at-sink/` is unaffected because `${escapeHtml(…)}`
//     supplies the `{` as a boundary.
//   - Two statements on one line are indistinguishable to the on-path test,
//     which compares LINES because that is the resolution `TaintFlow.hops`
//     reports at. `const a = req.query.x; const c = escape(a);` written on one
//     line reads as sanitised. Reproduced, deliberately, by the bound test in
//     the suite — see the second MEASURED note there.
//   - A DIRECT flow from a dotted source (`db.query(req.query.id)`, no hops)
//     cannot establish the premise at all. See `chainNames`.
//   - A validator whose failing branch does not short-circuit still suppresses.
//     See the validator note above.

 *  - no name on the flow's chain appears bare in the first argument, so the

 *  - the first argument contains a placeholder token that was INSIDE a string

 *
 * The last test is the one worth explaining. Blanking is length-preserving by

 * `StructureIndex.blanked` was inside a literal — which distinguishes the `?` of
 * `'WHERE id = ?'` from the `?` of a ternary, and the `:name` of a named bind
 * from the `:` of an object literal, without lexing anything. Neither text alone
 * can make that distinction; the pair can.
