// VG-RTOS-003 — cross-file shared ISR variable missing `volatile`.
//
// #20d, and the third deliverable #20b was split away from. VG-RTOS-002 in
// `@vibeguard/rules` already catches this defect when the interrupt handler and
// the reader live in ONE file — its own description says "SAME-FILE ONLY". This
// is the rest of it: the handler in `isr.c`, the reader in `main.c`, and the
// shared variable declared in a header that both translation units include.
// That split is not an exotic arrangement; it is how a driver is normally
// written, and it is where a code generator puts one by default.
//
// ★ WHY THIS DID NOT WAIT FOR TYPE INFORMATION
//
// An earlier plan deferred this rule "until type information is available", on
// the correct observation that `volatile` is a property of the DECLARATION's
// type and that a lexical scan cannot tell one `count` from
// another `count`. The premise stopped holding once the decision was taken not
// to add an AST/parser dependency at all: there is no later phase in which types arrive
// for free, so "wait for types" would have meant waiting forever while the
// same-file half of the rule shipped and the cross-file half stayed a TODO. A
// permanently deferred rule and a deleted rule are the same artefact.
//
// So this is built the way VG-AISC-002 and VG-AISC-003 were: comparative
// evidence rather than absolute, a quoted-include closure as the guard on
// identity, deliberate under-approximation everywhere the text is ambiguous,
// and confidence capped at `medium` because the evidence is lexical.
//
// ★ THE ONE FALSE POSITIVE THAT MATTERS: TWO VARIABLES, ONE NAME
//
// Everything hard about this rule is that `tick_count` in `isr.c` and
// `tick_count` in `main.c` may be two unrelated objects. Three guards kill that,
// and each one is a silence rather than a guess:
//
//  1. EXACTLY ONE declaration in a project header, project-wide. Two headers
//     declaring the same name means the include path decides which one a given
//     file sees, and the include path is precisely what this analysis does not
//     have (`resolveSpecifier` refuses ambiguous suffix matches for the same
//     reason). Two declarations therefore produce silence, not a choice.
//  2. A CLOSED SET OF BUILTIN TYPES. `typedef volatile uint32_t reg_t;` makes
//     `reg_t tick;` a correctly-qualified declaration that contains no
//     `volatile` token, and no amount of regex on the declaration line can see
//     it. So a declaration whose type is not one of the builtin scalars is not
//     "unqualified", it is UNKNOWN, and unknown means quiet. This is why the
//     type set here is narrower than VG-RTOS-002's: that rule accepts `word` and
//     `byte`, which are Arduino typedefs and could carry `volatile` the same way.
//  3. NO SHADOWING DECLARATION in the accusing files. A parameter, a local, or a
//     struct member with the same name in the handler's file or the reader's
//     file means the token this rule counted as "the shared variable" may be
//     something else entirely. Silence again.
//
// ★ OPTIONS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED
//
//  - "Report any non-volatile global written in an ISR." Unshippable for the
//    same reason the naive form of VG-AISC-002 was: a file-local counter that
//    nothing outside the handler reads is not a bug, and firmware is full of
//    them. The finding has to be about a variable that is demonstrably SHARED,
//    which is what the header declaration plus a reader in another file
//    establishes.
//  - "Accept several declarations and pick the one inside the reader's include
//    closure." Attractive and wrong: preprocessor conditionals mean two
//    declarations can both be in the closure and only one be live, and this
//    analysis does not evaluate `#if`. Picking would be inventing the answer.
//  - "Trust that a name is shared because it looks global (SCREAMING_CASE, a
//    `g_` prefix)." A naming convention is not a declaration, and a rule that
//    fires on spelling would fire hardest on the tidy generated code this
//    project is aimed at.
//  - "Report the ISR write site instead of the declaration." The fix is on the
//    declaration — and on the definition, which must agree with it — so that is
//    where the finding is filed. The write and the read travel as
//    `relatedLocations`, which is what §21's schema exists for.
//
// ★ WHY THE ISR HEAD FORMS ARE COPIED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
//
// `collectIsrBlocks` is private to `packages/rules/src/rules/embedded-rtos.ts`.
// Exporting it would promote one rule's internal heuristic into
// `@vibeguard/rules`' published surface so that a single consumer on the other
// side of the package boundary could share it — the same trade `metrics/index.ts`
// refused when it duplicated `BRANCH_WORD`/`BRANCH_OP`, and it is refused here
// for the same reason. The copy is exact and the mitigation is the same one: the
// head forms are pinned in this rule's test, so a divergence from VG-RTOS-002
// surfaces as a failing assertion rather than as two rules quietly disagreeing
// about what an interrupt handler is.
