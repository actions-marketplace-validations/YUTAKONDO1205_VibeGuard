// Internal types for the cross-file analysis graph.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM findings-schema
//
// `@vibeguard/findings-schema` is the contract with the OUTSIDE: what a consumer
// of a scan result receives. Everything here is the contract between the four
// submodules INSIDE this package (structure-indexer, dependency-graph,
// symbol-table, metrics) and the cross-file rules that read them. Those two
// contracts change for different reasons and at different rates — an internal
// refactor of how handlers are located must not be a schema change visible to
// the SARIF adapter — so they are separate files, and only the finding shapes
// cross the boundary.
//
// WHY THESE TYPES ARE BACKEND-AGNOSTIC
//
// 0.3.0-α indexes source LEXICALLY: regex heads plus balanced-block extraction
// over text with strings and comments blanked out, reusing the primitives that
// `@vibeguard/rules` already ships and already tests (`extractBlockAfter`,
// `blankJsLiterals`, `blankPyLiterals`). No AST parser is introduced, and that
// is a deliberate decision rather than a shortcut:
//
//  - The absolute constraint on this phase is that AST dependencies stay inside
//    this package so the "zero dependency / light / four channels agree" pillars
//    survive. Taking a parser dependency satisfies the letter of that (it IS
//    inside this package) while spending the thing the constraint protects: a
//    CLI user would install tens of megabytes of parser to run a design-smell
//    check. Not taking one satisfies it absolutely — this package has no
//    third-party dependencies at all.
//  - A parser buys exactness in TS/JS and nothing at all in Python, C, or the
//    five other languages on the roadmap, each of which would need its own. The
//    lexical layer generalises across all of them with one mechanism.
//
// The cost is real and is not hidden: lexical indexing cannot resolve types,
// cannot follow aliases, and will mis-handle sufficiently exotic syntax. Every
// rule built on it is therefore written to be conservative — see the negative
// conditions in design-smells-crossfile — and the finding confidence caps in
// this package reflect that the evidence is structural, not semantic.
//
// The escape hatch is the shape of `StructureIndex` itself: it describes WHAT a
// backend must produce, not HOW. Swapping in an AST-backed indexer later means
// adding a producer, not changing every consumer.
