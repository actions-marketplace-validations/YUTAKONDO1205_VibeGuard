// The adjudicator: given the bytes an agent is about to write, decide whether
// they may land, and say why.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ★★ THE DESIGN QUESTION: DOES THIS TOOL WRITE THE FILE, OR ONLY ADJUDICATE?
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// IT ONLY ADJUDICATES. No SHIPPED module here imports `node:fs` — `guard.ts`,
// `server.ts`, `protocol.ts`, `main.ts` and `index.ts` have no filesystem
// capability at all, and that is the single most important sentence in this
// file. (`server.test.ts` does read from disk, to walk this directory and
// assert the property; a test that proves the absence has to be able to look.)
// The four arguments, in the order that decided it:
//
// 1. WRITING BUYS NO ENFORCEMENT, so it is pure cost. The tempting story is
//    "if the guard performs the write, the guard cannot be bypassed". It can:
//    the client chooses which tool to call. Any agent able to call this server
//    is, by construction, an agent with tools — including whatever filesystem
//    or shell tool it was already using to edit code. Making this server a
//    writer does not remove that tool; it adds a second one. Enforcement lives
//    in the CLIENT's tool allowlist, one layer up, and no amount of capability
//    down here can manufacture it. A mechanism that adds power without adding
//    the guarantee it was added for is a mechanism to delete.
//
// 2. THE PRODUCT'S CLAIM IS "WE DO NOT WIDEN THE ATTACK SURFACE". An MCP server
//    that writes is an arbitrary-file-write primitive reachable by anything
//    that can speak newline JSON-RPC to a pipe — and MCP servers are launched
//    by editors, wrapped by proxies, and increasingly exposed over transports
//    their author did not choose. Confining it would mean a root allowlist,
//    symlink resolution, and a path-traversal policy: a configuration system,
//    which this PoC is explicitly not building, guarding a capability it does
//    not need. VibeGuard would then ship a file-writing daemon in the name of
//    security. The security tool becoming the most valuable target in the
//    toolchain is the failure mode this whole product line argues against.
//
// 3. THE SCAN IS PURE, AND THAT IS WHY IT AGREES ACROSS FOUR CHANNELS. `scan()`
//    is a function from (text, language) to findings, with no I/O anywhere in
//    it — which is exactly why the Chrome extension, which has no filesystem at
//    all, runs the same engine as the CLI. Bolting a write onto the one caller
//    that happens to have a filesystem would make this the only channel whose
//    behaviour depends on the disk, and would put a `write()` inside a
//    request/response cycle that currently cannot fail for environmental
//    reasons (EACCES, ENOSPC, EROFS, a read-only container).
//
// 4. A REFUSAL IS THE ONLY OUTPUT THAT MATTERS, and it is a pure value. Every
//    interesting behaviour here — the finding list, the reason discriminant,
//    the fail-closed path — is observable, testable, and reproducible without a
//    temp directory. That is not a convenience; a guard whose verdict can only
//    be tested by observing the filesystem is a guard whose tests are slower
//    than the thing they test and will be skipped.
//
// THE HONEST COST, stated because the argument is not free: this makes the
// guardrail ADVISORY. An agent that ignores the refusal and writes anyway is not
// stopped by anything in this package. That is a real limitation and it is
// written in the README rather than glossed; the mitigation is client-side (the
// agent is given this tool and not a raw writer), and the mitigation is out of
// this package's reach by the argument in (1) above.

 *
 * ★ WHY THIS NUMBER AND NOT ANOTHER
 *
 * It is not a new policy. `--fail-on high` is already the CLI's default, so it
 * is already what the GitHub Action refuses to merge. Setting the guard to the
 * same line means a blocked write is never a write that would have survived
 * review — the guard moves an existing verdict earlier in time, which is the
 * entire thesis of this package, rather than inventing a stricter one that only
 * the guard enforces. An agent that satisfies the guard has, by construction,
 * satisfied the gate its pull request will meet.
 *
 * ★ WHY NOT `medium`, which `isSecurityJudgementSeverity` includes
 *
 * `findings-schema` treats critical/high/medium as "security judgements" — the
 * band that a suppression may not silence. Blocking is a strictly harsher
 * response than refusing-to-silence, so it needs a stricter bar. Medium is
 * where the low-confidence rules live (`VG-CRYPTO-001` ships with
 * `defaultConfidence: 'low'`, and it fires on a bare md5 call in any language), and
 * a guard that blocks on those puts the agent in a loop it cannot exit: it
 * cannot fix code that is not broken, so it will retry, rewrite around the
 * detector, or — the realistic outcome — the human removes the guard from the
 * client config. A guard that gets switched off protects nothing, so its
 * false-positive budget is a security parameter and not a UX one.
 *
 * Medium and below are still REPORTED on the allow path. Not blocking is not
 * the same as not saying.
