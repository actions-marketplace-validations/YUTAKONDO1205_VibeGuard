// VG-EMB 18 FIX — deterministic, LLM-free, zero-send autofix.
//
// A fixer table keyed by rule ID, DELIBERATELY separate from RuleDefinition:
//   - the rules package is the detection core shipped to all four channels; the
//     Chrome / VS Code bundles do not need fix code.
//   - one file enumerates exactly which rules are auto-fixable — auditable at a
//     glance.
//   - no findings-schema / RuleDefinition churn.
// The drift risk (a stale ruleId key) is closed by fixers.test.ts, which asserts
// every key here exists in `allRules`.
//
// THE DESIGN PRINCIPLE, one line: a fixer's `build` returns edits ONLY when the
// fix is deterministically correct from the file bytes alone, and `null`
// otherwise. It never invents data the code does not contain (a buffer size, a
// certificate, a credential) and never changes a signature. Fixes that would
// require any of that carry NO fixer — prose remediation only.
//
// `safety`:
//   - 'safe'         : strictly-stronger semantics, applyable without review.
//   - 'needs-review' : correct and fail-closed, but changes behaviour (a TLS
//                      handshake starts validating, a bypass turns off) — a human
//                      must confirm the intent.

//      into a guard would emit a reference to an undeclared identifier. A fixer
//      has to be stricter than the detector, never looser.
//   2. the closing `)` and the body's `{` are REQUIRED. The rule does not need
//      them; the insertion point does.
// Bounded quantifiers only (D3): every `{0,n}`/`{1,n}` run is adjacent to a

/**
 * Insert the own-key guard as the first statement of an unguarded for-in merge.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DETERMINISTIC: every byte of the inserted text comes from the file
 * — the loop variable is re-extracted lexically from the loop header, the
 * indentation is copied from a neighbouring line, the line terminator is the
 * one this file already uses. Nothing is invented; the three guarded keys are
 * the fixed, language-defined set of prototype sinks (they are also exactly what
 * the rule's own `remediation.exampleFix` prescribes).
 *
 * WHY ANCHORING AT THE COLUMN IS LOAD-BEARING: VG-INJ-020 reports TWO shapes
 * under one rule ID. Branch A is a literal write into a prototype sink
 * (`obj.__proto__ = x`) and its match column points at the SINK; Branch B is
 * the unguarded recursive merge and its column points at the `for` keyword. A
 * for-in guard inserted for a Branch A finding is at best the wrong fix and, on
 * a line like `obj.__proto__ = {}; for (const k in src) {`, silently edits a
 * loop nobody complained about. Searching forward from the column (what
 * `tokenSwap` does) would do exactly that. Requiring the loop header to begin AT
 * the reported column makes Branch A structurally unfixable — it can never point
 * at a `for` — so no shape test, denylist, or evidence sniffing is needed.
 *
 * REJECTED ALTERNATIVES:
 *   - rewriting the loop to `for (const k of Object.keys(src))`: changes
 *     iteration semantics (own vs inherited enumerable keys) and would silently
 *     drop keys the program was relying on. `continue` on the three sinks is the
 *     minimal edit that closes CWE-1321.
 *   - matching the file's quote style for the three literals: sniffing quotes is
 *     a heuristic, and the guard is correct either way. Double quotes are used
 *     unconditionally; a formatter settles the rest.
 *   - brace-less bodies (`for (k in o) dst[k] = src[k];`): fixing those needs a
 *     block to be SYNTHESISED around the statement, i.e. deciding where the
 *     statement ends. That is parsing, not lexing — `null`.
