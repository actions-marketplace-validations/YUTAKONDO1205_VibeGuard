/**
 * Suppress-comment parsing.
 *
 * ── A NOTE ON THE SPELLINGS BELOW ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The directives are written here as `vibeguard:disable-{line,next-line,file}`
 * and the examples use a `‹›`-wrapped rule ID, rather than the literal forms.
 * That is not squeamishness: `PRAGMA_RE` matches raw line text and does not
 * care that the text is documentation, so writing the literal directive in this
 * comment ARMS it. Before this note, the list above opened a wildcard file-wide
 * suppression on this very file, and the example below opened a NAMED one for
 * `VG-AUTH-003`/`VG-AUTH-004` — which, being named, is honoured at every
 * severity. Neither was hiding a finding today; both would have hidden the
 * first one to appear, in the module that implements suppression.
 *
 * `check-packaging-invariants.mjs` counts file-scope pragmas and will flag a
 * new one, which is how this was found.
 *
 * Recognised pragmas (case-sensitive):
 *   vibeguard:disable-{line}       — suppress findings on this line
 *   vibeguard:disable-{next-line}  — suppress findings on the following line
 *   vibeguard:disable-{file}       — suppress findings for the entire file
 *
 * After the directive, the rest of the line may contain (in any order):
 *   - Rule IDs (e.g. `VG-INJ-004 VG-AUTH-003`). When listed, only those rules
 *     are suppressed; when omitted, every rule is suppressed for that scope.
 *   - `until=YYYY-MM-DD` — turns this into a *temporary* suppression. Once the
 *     current date is past the until date the entry is ignored at parse time,
 *     so the underlying finding starts surfacing again automatically.
 *   - `reason="free text"` (or `reason=word`) — informational; recorded on
 *     the entry so tooling can surface it without altering matching.
 *
 * Examples (substitute the braces for the real directive; see the note above).
 * The call is written as a placeholder rather than a real sink for the same
 * reason the directives are: an example that trips a rule needs a suppression to
 * sit quietly, and the only suppression available here is the one this comment
 * just showed you how to write.
 *   dangerousCall(payload); // vibeguard:disable-{line} VG-INJ-004
 *   // vibeguard:disable-{next-line} VG-INJ-004 until=2026-12-31 reason="ticket #42"
 *   // vibeguard:disable-{file} VG-AUTH-003 VG-AUTH-004
 *
 * Listing rule IDs is no longer merely good style. A directive with no rule IDs
 * is a wildcard, and a wildcard cannot suppress a finding whose severity
 * carries a security judgement (critical/high/medium — see
 * `SECURITY_JUDGEMENT_SEVERITIES` in @vibeguard/findings-schema for where the
 * line is and why). Such a finding is reported anyway, carrying a
 * `suppressionOverridden` record of the refusal. Wildcards keep working as
 * before for `low`/`info`, which is the band the blanket form exists to serve.

 * True when the character at `index` sits inside a quoted string on `line`.
 *
 * A pragma is a COMMENT directive, but `PRAGMA_RE` matches raw line text and

 * string documenting the feature —
 *
 *   const HELP = 'To silence this, write vibeguard:disable-file VG-AUTH-004';
 *
 * — silenced VG-AUTH-004 for the entire file. Prose explaining the suppression
 * syntax disabled the scanner, and an attacker could do the same by adding one
 * string to any file in a pull request.
 *
 * Scanning is per line and stops at the first comment opener found OUTSIDE a
 * string, after which everything is comment and any pragma is legitimate. That
 * bound is deliberate. Carrying quote state ACROSS lines would let one
 * apostrophe in a comment — `// don't` — swallow the rest of the file and
 * reject every real suppression after it. Per-line state cannot do that.
 *
 * The cost is that a pragma inside a MULTI-LINE string (a Python docstring, a
 * JS template literal, a C++ raw string) is still honoured; those are the same
 * residual class the canonicalizer documents. The error direction here is the
 * safe one either way: misjudging a real pragma as string-embedded reports a
 * finding the user wanted hidden, which is noise, while the reverse hides a
 * finding nobody chose to hide.
