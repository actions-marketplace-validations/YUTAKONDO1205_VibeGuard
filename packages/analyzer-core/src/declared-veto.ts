/**
 * The declared-package veto — §17z-b, the second half of the sentence "a
 * hallucinated dependency is a name that is a near miss of a popular package
 * AND IS NOT IN THE LOCKFILE".
 *
 * VG-AISC-001 currently implements only the first half, because `match()` is a
 * pure function of one file's text and a lockfile is a different file. This
 * module is the other half, placed where cross-file evidence is allowed to
 * live: the analyzer, which receives the evidence as data (`ScanRequest.
 * declaredPackages`) and never reads it itself.
 *
 * ── WHY THE EVIDENCE IS A LOCKFILE AND ONLY A LOCKFILE ────────────────────
 *
 * REJECTED: package.json / requirements.txt / pyproject.toml / Pipfile, i.e.
 * the manifests. They are the obvious source — they are small, easy to parse,
 * and they are what a human would look at — and they are the wrong one, for a
 * reason specific to the threat this rule is about. The finding says "a
 * generator invented this dependency". A generator that invents an import
 * routinely invents the manifest entry to go with it, in the same completion:
 * that is what "write me an app that does X" produces. Vetoing on the manifest
 * therefore deletes the finding in exactly the case the rule exists for — the
 * model wrote both halves of the lie and the lie is self-consistent.
 *
 * A lockfile cannot be produced that way. An entry in a lockfile carries a
 * RESOLVED version (and usually an integrity hash and a `resolved` URL), which
 * only exists because a package manager asked a registry for that name and the
 * registry answered. A manifest is a wish; a lockfile is a receipt. A
 * hallucinated name has no receipt: `npm install` / `pip install` fails on it
 * and the lockfile never gets the entry. That asymmetry — not convenience — is
 * why the veto reads one and not the other, and it is why the CLI-side reader
 * (apps/cli/src/declared-packages.ts) refuses to fall back to a manifest when
 * no lockfile is present.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS VETO DOES *NOT* CLAIM ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not claim the package is safe. Slopsquatting works by REGISTERING the
 * hallucinated name, and once a developer has run `npm install` on it the name
 * is in the registry, in the lockfile, and vetoed here. The veto is therefore
 * weakest precisely in the state where the attack has already landed. That is
 * accepted deliberately, because it is the honest scope of the claim being
 * refuted: VG-AISC-001 asserts "this name looks fabricated", and a resolved
 * lockfile entry disproves THAT, not "this dependency is trustworthy".
 * Detecting a malicious-but-real package is a different rule with a different
 * evidence source (registry age, download counts, install scripts), and
 * pretending this one covers it would be the overclaim.
 *
 * REJECTED: downgrading confidence instead of removing the finding. It reads as
 * the safer option and is not: a `low`-confidence supply-chain finding on every
 * legitimately-installed near-miss package (`psycopg`, `merge2`, `preact`,
 * `enquirer` — all confirmed real-world false positives) is the noise that gets
 * the whole rule switched off, which loses the true positives too. The finding
 * being refuted is not "quieter now", it is WRONG: its premise is that the name
 * does not resolve, and the lockfile is proof that it does.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ANALYZER AND NOT THE RULE ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `match()` stays a pure function of `RuleContext`. Three properties depend on
 * that and all three would break if a rule read a lockfile: the four delivery
 * channels agree only because they share one pure matcher (E1); the browser and
 * editor channels have no filesystem to read from; and "zero egress / no I/O
 * inside a rule" is the property the no-network CI job asserts. Passing the
 * declared set in as DATA keeps every one of them: a channel that has no
 * lockfile (Chrome, a snippet scan) simply passes nothing and gets today's
 * behaviour, byte for byte.
 */

/**
 * The `RuleMatch.variables` key by which a match declares "my subject is a
 * PACKAGE NAME, and this is the name".
 *
 * THIS IS THE WHOLE COUPLING between the veto and the rules. Deliberately NOT a
 * list of rule IDs: a `ruleId === 'VG-AISC-001'` test would mean every future
 * supply-chain rule silently opts out of the veto until someone remembers to
 * extend a list in a different package, and the failure mode of forgetting is a
 * false positive nobody can explain from reading either file. The contract is
 * instead a data contract, stated once here and honoured by construction:
 *
 *   A rule whose match names a package MUST put that name, as written in the
 *   source, in `variables.package`. Any such match is vetoed when the scan
 *   request declares that package. A rule that does not set the key is never
 *   touched by this code.
 *
 * `variables` is otherwise free-form (a remediation-template interpolation bag),
 * so `package` is reserved by this contract and must not be used for anything
 * that is not a package name. As of 0.2.1 the only producer is VG-AISC-001;
 * `matcher-utils.runRegex` also copies named capture groups into `variables`,
 * so a future rule with a `(?<package>…)` group opts in automatically — which
 * is the intended behaviour, not an accident, and is why the name is checked in
 * this file's tests rather than left implicit.
 *
 * WHY THE VETO CANNOT RUN LATER: `variables` exists on `RuleMatch` and NOT on
 * `Finding` — the analyzer consumes it (remediation interpolation) and drops
 * it. Once a finding is assembled the package name is gone and only a regex
 * over the snippet could recover it. So the veto must run before finding
 * assembly, which is also where it belongs for the merge reason below.

 *
 * Why the normalized form is compared at all, on top of the literal lowercase
 * one: PyPI names ARE separator- and case-insensitive by specification (PEP 503
 * normalizes `-`, `_` and `.` to one form), so `Flask_Cors` in a lockfile and
 * `flask-cors` in an import are the SAME package and a literal comparison would
 * miss it. npm is stricter — `body-parser` and `bodyparser` are two different
 * names there — so applying the normalized comparison uniformly is wider than
 * npm's own equality, and can veto an npm import that would genuinely fail to
 * resolve (`require('bodyparser')` in a project whose lockfile has
 * `body-parser`). That cost is accepted rather than split per-ecosystem: the
 * analyzer does not know which registry a name came from and should not learn,
 * and the over-vetoed case is a typo that fails loudly at `require()` time in
 * a project that already has the real package installed — not the silent
 * install-time compromise this rule exists to catch. REJECTED for that reason:
 * (a) literal-lowercase only, which breaks the veto on Python, the ecosystem
 * where slopsquatting is most measured; (b) an ecosystem switch inside the
 * analyzer, which would put registry-naming policy in the layer furthest from
 * the registry.
