// Pin test for `ENGINE_VERSION` — the detection-engine version stamped into
// every `ScanResponse` as `engineVersions.core`.
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
//
// `ENGINE_VERSION` is the field the README's central comparison contract rests
// on: "same engine ⇒ identical verdicts". Nothing in CI defended it. The
// constant lives one line away from `Analyzer`, is imported by five call sites
// across three packages, and looks exactly like the kind of string an agent
// bumps in passing while doing something else ("the package went to 0.2.0, so
// this should too"). That bump would be silent and destructive: every scan
// result emitted afterwards would claim to be a different engine, and every
// before/after comparison spanning the bump would be unfalsifiable, because the
// only machine-readable signal that two runs used the same detector would have
// been changed by hand rather than by a detection change.
//
// The hold at 0.1.0 was a decision on the record, not an oversight, and it was
// released on purpose on 2026-07-20. It is kept described here because the shape
// of the decision is the reason this test exists. Several changes had altered
// detection behaviour without a bump:
//
//   D1 / D1b / D1c  the severity gate on context-window confidence
//                   (`SEVERITY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` in @vibeguard/rules) — critical,
//                   high and medium findings keep their declared confidence in
//                   contexts that previously down-ranked them.
//   D2              the canonicalizer pre-pass — rules also run over normalized
//                   text, so lexically evaded payloads are now detected. Additive
//                   only, but still a behaviour change.
//   D3              regex time/length bounds and `ScanDegradation` — a scan that
//                   stopped early says so instead of looking clean.
//   D4              `confidenceAudit` on findings — values unchanged, schema not.
//   D5              the suppression severity gate — a wildcard no longer silences
//                   critical/high/medium, on both the pragma and config channels.
//   D6              `match-limit` degradations — hitting the per-file match cap on
//                   a security rule is reported instead of dropped.
//   D8              `ScanResponse.suppressions` — findings removed by a
//                   suppression are tallied.
//
// Each would have justified a bump on its own. The project deliberately took
// none of them, so that 0.2.0 names ONE settled engine rather than a sequence of
// partial states. The accepted consequence was that 0.1.0 did NOT satisfy the
// "same engine ⇒ identical verdicts" contract for the duration; the
// `v0.1.3` tag remains the sound baseline for a comparison against the
// pre-hold engine. That debt is discharged at 0.2.0, and no hold is in effect
// now. This test's job is to make sure the next release is also on purpose.
//
// WHAT TO DO WHEN THIS TEST FAILS
//
// A failure means someone changed `ENGINE_VERSION` (or a doc that quotes it).
// It is NOT automatically a bug — a release that changes detection is supposed
// to move this value. If the bump is intentional, update, in one change:
//
//   1. `EXPECTED_ENGINE_VERSION` below.
//   2. `ENGINE_VERSION` in `analyzer.ts`, and the long comment above it — the
//      "KNOWN HAZARD" paragraphs describe debt that a bump discharges, so they
//      must be rewritten, not left to describe a state that no longer exists.
//   3. `README.md` — the "Engine version" row of the Versioning table (the
//      `Current` column) and the prose paragraph below it, which quotes both the
//      value and the sample CLI banner `vibeguard <tool> (engine <engine>)`.
//      Both are asserted here, so a partial doc update fails this test.
//   4. `CHANGELOG.md` — add a NEW entry stating the bump and what detection
//      changes it covers. Do not edit the existing "stays at 0.1.0" entry: past
//      entries are a record of what shipped, and rewriting them would erase the
//      evidence that the hold was a decision.
//   5. `packages/sarif-adapter/src/index.ts` — the literal in
//      `options.toolVersion ?? scan.engineVersions.core ?? '<version>'`. This one
//      is NOT asserted below, because it is a fallback for a response that has no
//      engine version at all, and reaching it from a test would mean constructing
//      a `ScanResponse` this package never emits. It is listed here because an
//      unasserted literal is exactly the kind that drifts: it went one release
//      stale before anyone noticed.
//   6. `docs/DESIGN.ja.md` — the sample response in the interface section quotes
//      `"core"`. Also unasserted; also easy to miss.
//
// If the bump was NOT intentional, revert it. The tool version (`package.json`,
// CLI `--version`, SARIF `tool.version`) is the separate axis that moves on every
// release; it is almost always the one that was meant.
