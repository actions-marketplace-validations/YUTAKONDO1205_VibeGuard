/**
 * Detection-engine version, embedded in every scan result and SARIF report
 * (`engineVersions.core`). This is a SEPARATE axis from the released tool /
 * package version (package.json): bump it only when detection behavior changes
 * (rules, analysis, finding schema) — not for packaging, UX, or docs releases.
 * It deliberately stayed at 0.1.0 across tool releases 0.1.1–0.1.3, which did
 * not alter what VibeGuard detects.
 *
 * 0.2.0 (2026-07-20) ends a deliberate hold. The bump was deferred while a round
 * of detection changes was in flight, so that one version names ONE settled
 * engine rather than several successive ones. During the hold `engineVersions.core`
 * knowingly understated the engine and did NOT satisfy the "same engine ⇒
 * identical verdicts" contract in README.md; that debt is discharged here, and
 * `v0.1.3` remains the tag to compare against for the pre-hold engine.
 *
 * What 0.2.0 names, i.e. every change to detection behavior made under the hold:
 *
 *   - Context-window confidence, and its severity gate
 *     (`SEVERITY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` in @vibeguard/rules): critical/high/medium
 *     findings keep their declared confidence in contexts that previously
 *     down-ranked them. Down-ranking is triage, never a security verdict.
 *   - The canonicalizer pre-pass: rules also run over normalized text, so
 *     lexically evaded payloads (`"ev" + "al"`, `eval/*x*\/(…)`) are detected
 *     where they were not. The union can only ADD findings. Toggle with
 *     `AnalyzerOptions.canonicalize`.
 *   - Regex time and input-length bounds, plus `ScanDegradation`: a scan that
 *     stopped early now says so instead of looking clean. (Schema change.)
 *   - `confidenceAudit` on findings: the reasoning behind a confidence value is
 *     carried rather than recomputed. Values are unchanged. (Schema change.)
 *   - The suppression severity gate: a wildcard `vibeguard:disable` no longer
 *     silences critical/high/medium findings, on both the pragma and the config
 *     channel. Naming a rule still works at every severity. (BREAKING.)
 *   - `match-limit` degradations: hitting the per-file match cap on a
 *     security-severity rule is now reported instead of dropped. (Schema change.)
 *   - `ScanResponse.suppressions`: findings removed by a suppression are tallied,
 *     so concealment is on the record rather than indistinguishable from absence.
 *     Observability, not a defence — the suppression still applies. (Schema change.)
 *
 * `engine-version-pin.test.ts` guards this value and the docs that quote it, and
 * carries the checklist for changing it. There is no hold in effect: the next
 * bump is due when detection behavior changes again.
 *
 * 0.2.1 (2026-07-21) names the C/C++/Arduino embedded layer (VG-EMB): the
 * `.ino`/`.hh`/`.cxx`/`.ipp` extensions, the N_pp preprocessor-branch
 * normalization face (a third union term, C/C++ only), and 19 new rules across
 * VG-MEM / VG-EMB / VG-RTOS. This is a detection-behavior change (new rules, new
 * languages, a new normalization face), so the engine moves even though it is
 * purely ADDITIVE: web-language verdicts are untouched (E2=51 / E3=0 hold), and
 * the released `v0.2.0` tag remains the immutable baseline
 * for the pre-embedded engine. Nothing else about detection changed.
 *
 * 0.3.0 (2026-07-28) names the single-file design-smell and AI-supply-chain
 * layer. Like 0.2.1 it is ADDITIVE — no rule that existed at 0.2.1 changed what
 * it matches or at what severity — so `v0.2.0` and the engine-0.2.1 build remain
 * usable baselines for the rules they already had:
 *
 *   - New single-file rules: `VG-SMELL-003` (long security method),
 *     `VG-SMELL-004` (security Swiss army knife),
 *     `VG-SMELL-012` (primitive role check, TS/JS/Python plus Java, Go, Kotlin),
 *     `VG-AISC-001` (hallucinated dependency) and `VG-INJ-020`
 *     (prototype-polluting merge).
 *   - Per-match severity (`RuleMatch.severity`): a match may escalate above its
 *     rule's static severity on its own content, and the suppression severity
 *     gate then applies at the escalated value. Only the new rules set it, so
 *     nothing already shipped moves.
 *   - The declared-package veto (`declared-veto.ts`): `VG-AISC-001` findings are
 *     dropped for packages the project's LOCKFILE declares. It can only silence
 *     a rule introduced in this same release.
 *
 * The cross-file analysis added in the same release (`@vibeguard/analysis-graph`
 * — `VG-SMELL-010`, `VG-AISC-002`, `VG-AISC-003`, `VG-RTOS-003`, reached through
 * `--include-design-smells`) does NOT move this constant, and the changes to
 * `VG-SMELL-010`'s severity conditions are not changes to this engine. That pass
 * is opt-in, the core path never imports it, and it reports its own axis as
 * `engineVersions['analysis-graph']`.
 *
 * ★ That axis reads `0.3.0-beta.4` as of tool 0.3.6 (it moved for #35, which
 * changed what `VG-SMELL-021` counts; again for #41, which stopped the
 * type-erasure filter depending on a defect in how the indexer records exports;
 * and again for the file-route conventions that let `VG-SMELL-013` reach its
 * decision point on a Next.js `pages/api` tree), and the correction matters
 * more than the number does. It was left at `0.3.0-alpha.1` — described here as
 * "held at", as though standing still were the decision — through a wave that
 * added `VG-SMELL-020/021/041/052`. A scan running those four therefore
 * announced the same version an alpha build announced while running half as
 * many rules, which is the single failure a version axis exists to prevent.
 * Whether the cross-file version moves is a question that has to be asked every
 * time the cross-file rule SET changes, not once.
 *
 * 0.3.1 (2026-07-29) is the first bump that is NOT additive. Every release
 * before it could say "no rule that already existed changed what it matches";
 * this one cannot, because it follows a deep audit whose whole subject was
 * existing rules getting it wrong. A file's verdict may differ between 0.3.0
 * and 0.3.1 in BOTH directions, which is precisely what this axis exists to
 * signal — comparing two runs across it is not meaningful.
 *
 * Fewer findings:
 *   - `VG-INJ-005` no longer reports `yaml.load(…, Loader=SafeLoader)`. The
 *     veto recognised only the `yaml.`-qualified spelling, so the form PyYAML's
 *     own documentation uses failed the default `--fail-on high` gate on code
 *     that had already done the right thing. `CSafeLoader` and `BaseLoader` are
 *     recognised too; `FullLoader` and `UnsafeLoader` still report.
 *   - A `//` comment continued by a backslash no longer reports its continuation
 *     line as live code (C/C++/Arduino translation phase 2).
 *   - `return /re/` is read as a regex literal, so its BODY is no longer
 *     reported as code.
 *
 * More findings:
 *   - The canonical/raw merge no longer drops a distinct payload as a duplicate.
 *     A raw match may veto a canonical one only when it sits on text that
 *     survived normalisation — before, a match inside a blanked comment could
 *     displace the assignment that actually ran.
 *   - `VG-SMELL-012` is no longer disabled for a whole file by a STRING that
 *     merely mentions `Object.freeze(`.
 *   - A sink written inside a template substitution (`${…}`) is visible; the
 *     substitution is evaluated code, not template text.
 *   - A suppression pragma quoted inside a string literal no longer silences the
 *     file, so findings it was hiding reappear.
 *
 * Output, not detection, but shipped here: `category: secrets` findings are
 * redacted by shape rather than by quoting, so an unquoted or short credential
 * no longer reaches `snippet`/`evidence` — and therefore no longer reaches an
 * uploaded SARIF report. `declaredPackageVetoes` records what the lockfile veto
 * removed, on the response instead of only on stderr.
 *
 * 0.3.2 (2026-08-06, shipped in tool 0.3.5) names two C/C++ rules for defences a
 * compiler is entitled to delete: `VG-MEM-006` (a secret buffer cleared with a
 * `memset` that is a dead store by the time the buffer leaves scope) and
 * `VG-AUTH-008` (an authorization decision made by `assert`, which `NDEBUG`
 * removes from exactly the builds that ship). Both are scoped to `c` and `cpp`.
 * ADDITIVE: no rule that existed at 0.3.1 changed what it matches or at what
 * severity, and neither new rule fires anywhere in the pinned corpora, so a scan
 * of any other language is unchanged.
 *
 * ★ This paragraph was written on 2026-08-18, during the 0.3.6 close-out, and not
 * when 0.3.2 shipped. The bump was correct and the release notes were complete;
 * the narrative here — which the pin test's own instruction #2 requires be
 * rewritten with every bump — was simply not updated, and the omission survived
 * because nothing asserts that this comment mentions the current value. It is
 * recorded rather than quietly backfilled, because "the checklist was followed"
 * and "the checklist was followed except for the unasserted step" are different
 * facts about how much this file can be trusted.
 *
 * 0.3.3 (2026-08-18) names a change that is visible on ONE surface and in the
 * response schema, and in neither case as a new rule.
 *
 * The declared-package veto reads a lockfile and uses it as evidence that a
 * dependency `VG-AISC-001` calls hallucinated is in fact declared. Its reader
 * lived inside `apps/cli`, so only the CLI applied it: the VS Code extension
 * built its Analyzer without a declared set and reported every false positive the
 * lockfile refutes. The reader now lives here, reachable through
 * `@vibeguard/analyzer-core/node` only, so the browser entry cannot import
 * `node:fs` even by mistake. What moves:
 *
 *   - Fewer findings IN THE EDITOR. A `VG-AISC-001` finding the lockfile refutes
 *     is no longer reported in VS Code. The CLI's verdicts do not change — it
 *     already did this — and Chrome's do not either, and cannot: a browser has no
 *     lockfile, and fetching one would break the zero-egress posture.
 *   - `ScanResponse.declaredPackageVetoes` gains an observable EMPTY state. It
 *     was present only when non-empty, which collapsed "no declared set reached
 *     this scan, so nothing could have been removed" together with "the veto ran
 *     against a real lockfile and removed nothing". Those are now `absent` and
 *     `[]` respectively, and a consumer that distinguishes them gets different
 *     bytes for the same project than it did at 0.3.2.
 *
 * The second item is why this is a bump rather than a bug fix: the field's
 * meaning changed, and `D4` in the list above ("`confidenceAudit` on findings —
 * values unchanged, schema not") is the precedent that a schema change alone
 * justifies moving this constant.

/**
 * Turn D3's regex bounds into `degradations` — a channel SEPARATE from
 * `ruleErrors`.
 *
 * The first version routed these through `ruleErrors`, and that was wrong: the
 * CLI renders `ruleErrors` under "rule(s) errored and were skipped — findings
 * NOT reported", which is the opposite of what a truncation is (the rule ran and
 * DID report findings, just not past the cap). A degradation carries its own
 * kind and its `filePath`, so a directory scan can name the file, and the
 * renderer can use words that are true.
 *
 * DEDUPLICATED PER RULE AND KIND. A rule holding seven patterns (VG-CRYPTO-002)
 * would otherwise emit seven identical truncation entries for one oversized
 * file, burying the signal. The first event of each kind carries the report.
 *
 * A1-LIMIT — `limitReached` is surfaced BY SEVERITY, not dropped wholesale.
 *
 * The previous rule here was "never surface it": the cap fires on any file with
 * more than REGEX_MATCH_LIMIT matches of one rule, which is common and usually
 * benign, and flooding this channel with it would train readers to ignore the
 * two bounds that do matter. That reasoning holds for quality rules and only for
 * quality rules. Measured on a 1500-`eval` file, the old behaviour reported
 * exactly 1000 critical findings, 500 more that existed were dropped, and
 * `degradations` came back empty — a scan that had silently stopped counting
 * looked byte-for-byte like a scan that was complete. That is the same failure
 * mode D5 closes on the suppression side: a utility-grade convenience deciding a
 * security question in silence.
 *
 * So the split follows the SAME boundary as D5 and D1c, through the same shared
 * predicate: if the rule's severity is one the tool's security judgement rests
 * on (critical/high/medium per `isSecurityJudgementSeverity`), the truncation is
 * reported; low/info keep the old silence. One principle, one predicate, three
 * enforcement points.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does NOT do:
 *  - It does not raise or remove the cap. The cap is what bounds A1's
 *    availability attack; A1-LIMIT only makes its effect visible.
 *  - It does not emit one degradation per lost finding. The report is aggregated
 *    to ONE entry per (file, rule) — see the dedup below — so the channel stays
 *    readable no matter how many matches were cut. It also cannot state the
 *    excess, because matching stopped at the cap and never counted the rest;
 *    saying "500 were dropped" would be a number nobody measured.

/**
 * Merge the canonical pass's matches into the original pass's.
 *
 * Deduped per rule by SOURCE OVERLAP, not by equal start position, because
 * normalization moves a match in two different ways:
 *
 *   - Blanking a comment turns its line into whitespace, so a `^\s*`-anchored
 *     pattern under `/m` reaches further back and starts EARLIER.
 *   - Folding rewrites `"-" + "AKIA…"` as `"-AKIA…"` left-aligned in the span,
 *     so the payload starts EARLIER within the line.
 *
 * Either way the canonical match still covers the same source as the original
 * one, and two matches of one rule over overlapping text are one finding. Exact
 * position comparison misses both cases and reports the same secret twice.
 *
 * The ORIGINAL match wins a collision: its evidence and position describe the
 * text the user actually wrote. Only matches the original pass could not see at
 * all — the de-obfuscated ones — are appended, and those are re-anchored to
 * their payload so the finding points at the real line rather than at whatever
 * blank run the pattern happened to start in. Without that, a canonical-only
 * finding on CRLF input lands on the wrong line and no `vibeguard:disable-line`
 * on the payload line can suppress it.
 *
 * WHAT OVERLAP ALONE GOT WRONG. Blanking a comment does not only let a pattern
 * reach further BACK — it also lets a canonical match SPAN the blank run, and a
 * raw match living inside that comment then overlaps it. Those two matches are
 * not one finding; they are a real one and a match on comment text. Dropping
 * the canonical one loses the real detection and leaves the comment match
 * standing in its place, wearing its position and its evidence.
 *
 * The shape is an object literal whose key and value are split by a BLOCK
 * COMMENT, with a second, unrelated match for the same rule written inside that
 * comment. The raw pass matches the comment text on its own line. The canonical
 * pass matches the property assignment that actually runs, and because the
 * comment between the key and the value is now blank, that match SPANS the
 * comment line. Overlap read the two as one finding and kept the original — so
 * the executed assignment vanished and a comment was reported in its place.
 *
 * A reviewer's natural response to that report — suppress what looks like a
 * false positive on a comment line — then silences the file completely. The
 * worked example is `merge-payload.test.ts`, which keeps it where a fixture
 * belongs rather than in a doc comment the scanner has to read.
 *
 * So a raw match may only veto a canonical one when it sits on text that
 * SURVIVED normalisation. `spanWasRemoved` is that test. Both legitimate cases
 * above still dedup, because in both the original match is on real code.

      //   field absent   the veto did not run: nobody handed this scan a
      //                  declared set, so no finding COULD have been removed.
      //                  Every Chrome scan is this, permanently and by design
      //                  (a browser has no lockfile, and fetching one would
      //                  break the zero-egress posture) — see
      //                  `extensions/chrome/src/shared/block-scan.ts`.
      //   `[]`           the veto ran against real evidence and removed
      //                  nothing. The findings above are the whole story.
      //   non-empty      the veto ran and deleted these.
      //
      // Collapsing the first two — which is what emitting the field only when
      // non-empty did — makes "this tool never looked at your lockfile" and
      // "this tool looked and your lockfile refuted nothing" the same document.
      // That matters most for the channel that can never look: a Chrome report
      // and a CLI report would claim the same clean bill of health while only
      // one of them had checked. A mechanism that deletes findings has to say
      // when it was armed, not only when it fired.

      // who looked for a lockfile and found nothing usable armed the veto with
      // nothing, and no finding could have been removed either way. The
      // producer knows which of those two happened and is the only one who can
      // report it (see `ScanRequest.declaredPackages`).
