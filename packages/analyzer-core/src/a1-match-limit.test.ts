 *
 * The cap itself is not on trial here and is not changed by any of this. It is
 * the bound that keeps A1's availability attack bounded, and every test below
 * asserts that it STILL applies: the finding count stays at REGEX_MATCH_LIMIT.
 * What changed is only whether a reader is told, and that is what these tests
 * pin down.
 *
 * The measurement that motivated the change is reproduced verbatim in the first
 * test. Before A1-LIMIT, a file with 1500 `eval` calls produced exactly 1000
 * critical findings and an EMPTY `degradations` array — a truncated scan whose
 * response was indistinguishable from a complete one. `legacyDegradations`
 * below re-implements that old filter so the silent drop is demonstrated to
 * have been real rather than merely asserted to have been.
