/**
 * D2 — normalization pre-pass (the canonicalizer).
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE PROBLEM. Evasion is a semantics-preserving input transform
 * `t` chosen so the detector disagrees with itself: `D(t(x)) ≠ D(x)`. The
 * defense is a normalization map `N` that projects an input onto the canonical
 * representative of its equivalence class under those transforms, so that
 * `D(N(t(x))) = D(N(x))`. Evasion and defense are dual — a transform group
 * against a normal form.
 *
 * `N` is deliberately restricted to three semantics-preserving operations:
 *   (1) comment removal
 *   (2) whitespace normalization
 *   (3) constant-only string-concatenation folding (`"ev" + "al"` → `"eval"`)
 *
 * Folding stops at constants because folding `x + y` requires runtime values.
 * The complete normalization of meaning is undecidable (a Rice-theorem wall),
 * so `N` can only collapse a decidable sub-family of transforms and RESIDUAL
 * EVASION NECESSARILY EXISTS. That residue is pinned by tests rather than
 * papered over — see `canonicalizer-soundness.test.ts`.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE DOES NOT REPLACE THE SCANNED CONTENT. The obvious reading of
 * "normalize before matching" is to feed `N(x)` to the rules instead of `x`.
 * That is unsound here, and the rules themselves prove it:
 *
 *   - `secrets.ts` runs `runRegex(ctx.content, …)` with no `skipCommentLines`.
 *     An AWS key sitting in a comment is a genuinely leaked credential and is
 *     detected today. Blanking comments first would erase it.
 *   - VG-AUTH-002 and VG-QUAL-009 match ON the comment markers themselves
 *     (`/(?:\/\/|#|\/\*)\s*(?:TODO|FIXME…)/`). For them the comment IS the
 *     signal — both carry `contextConfidence: 'off'` for exactly that reason.
 *     Blanking comments makes those rules match nothing at all.
 *
 * Both failures are silent false negatives, which this codebase treats as
 * strictly worse than false positives: a dropped match never reaches the
 * analyzer's confidence chokepoint, so the severity gate cannot bound the
 * mistake, whereas a noisy finding is visible and triageable. (Same asymmetry
 * argued at length on `LINE_COMMENT_SPECS` in matcher-utils.)
 *
 * So the analyzer runs rules over BOTH the original and the canonical content
 * and merges: `D′(x) = D(x) ∪ D(N(x))`. `D′(x) ⊇ D(x)` then holds BY
 * CONSTRUCTION for every input — the soundness obligation is discharged by the
 * shape of the composition, not by passing a corpus. `analyzer.ts` owns the
 * union; this module only computes `N`.
 *
 * GEOMETRY IS LOAD-BEARING. Findings carry `startLine`/`startColumn` straight
 * from the match, snippets are cut from `ctx.lines`, and suppressions are keyed
 * by original line number. So `N` is LENGTH- AND NEWLINE-PRESERVING: removed
 * characters are overwritten with U+0020 and folded literals are right-padded,
 * never shifted. Canonical-space positions are therefore identity-mapped to
 * original-space positions, and no consumer of a position needs to know this
 * pass exists. The alternative — a canonical→original source map — would put a
 * translation seam in front of findings, suppressions, snippets and
 * remediation, each one an off-by-one waiting to happen.
 *
 * Comment syntax is NOT decided here. It comes from `getLineCommentSpec` /
 * `lineCommentStartsAt` in @vibeguard/rules, the single source of truth that
 * also backs `runRegex({ skipCommentLines })` and the confidence scanner.
 * Rolling a private comment model here would reopen the concealment vectors
 * that allowlist closes (`//` in python, `#` in html, PHP 8's `#[Attribute]`,
 * and undetected languages).

/**
 * `N_pp` — the preprocessor normalization arm (VG-EMB 17c EMB-LANG).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM N ALONE DOES NOT SOLVE. In C/C++ a dangerous construct can be
 * split across preprocessor directives, which are neither comments nor
 * whitespace, so both D(x) and D(N(x)) see them as line-breaking tokens:
 *
 *     WiFi.begin("ssid",
 *     #ifdef PROD
 *         PROD_PW);
 *     #else
 *         "test123");
 *     #endif
 *
 * A bounded call-shape pattern cannot reach across the `#ifdef` line, so the
 * literal in the first branch is never joined to the call. N_pp blanks the
 * DIRECTIVE lines (newline-preserving, exactly as a comment is blanked) so a
 * bounded pattern can span them into the first branch.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. Branches are NOT expanded and macros are NOT
 * substituted: "surface dangerous code in any branch" needs every branch to
 * stay VISIBLE, which the source already guarantees, not the code compiled.
 * Blanking makes only the FIRST branch contiguous with the text before the
 * directive; a payload reachable only through the `#else` arm stays separated by
 * the first branch's text and is NOT surfaced. That is a pinned residual (see
 * canonicalizer.test.ts), not a silent gap — expanding branches is exponential
 * under nesting and budget-hostile, and the union can still only ADD findings,
 * so the honest partial win is taken over none.
 *
 * FALSE POSITIVES. Splicing one branch's tail to the next branch's head can form
 * a statement present in no build. This is the same chimera class N already
 * accepts from block-comment blanking, and it is bounded: `foldConcatenations`
 * refuses to cross a physical line, so two mutually-exclusive branches' literals
 * can never be merged into one fabricated secret. Under this codebase's
 * asymmetry — a visible false positive is triageable, a silent false negative is
 * not — this is accepted.
 *
 * COMPOSITION. N_pp(x) = N(ppBlank(x)): directives are blanked first, then the
 * full N pipeline runs, so a secret split by BOTH a directive and a comment
 * still folds. Length- and newline-preserving by the same construction as N, so
 * canonical-space positions are identity-mapped to the original and
 * `anchorMatch` (analyzer.ts) re-anchors an N_pp-only finding to its payload
 * line. The analyzer unions the result: D′(x) = D(x) ∪ D(N(x)) ∪ D(N_pp(x)).
 *
 * `changed` is measured against the ORIGINAL, not against the blanked text: the
 * caller uses it to decide whether this face adds anything over D(x), and skips
 * the third rule pass when it does not.
