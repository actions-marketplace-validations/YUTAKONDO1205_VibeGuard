/**
 * Lockfile reading for the declared-package veto (§17z-b).
 *
 * This is the ONLY place in VibeGuard that turns a lockfile into evidence, and
 * every channel that has a filesystem reads it through this one function.
 *
 * ── WHY IT LIVES HERE, AND WHY IT USED TO LIVE IN THE CLI ─────────────────
 *
 * It was written in `apps/cli/src/declared-packages.ts`, with a docstring
 * arguing that analyzer-core must stay bundleable for the browser and that
 * putting `node:fs` in this package would break the Chrome build. That argument
 * was half right and the conclusion was wrong, and the cost of the wrong half
 * was a real defect: the VS Code extension constructed its `Analyzer` with no
 * declared set and passed none on the request, so the same project scanned from
 * the editor and from the command line disagreed — every hallucinated-dependency
 * false positive the lockfile refutes on the CLI was still reported in the
 * editor. A channel cannot share an implementation that lives inside another
 * channel, so it grew a second answer by growing none at all.
 *
 * The half that was right: nothing on the browser path may import `node:fs`.
 * The half that was wrong: "the package" is not one entry point. This package
 * already ships two — `.` (Node: it exports `scanPath`, which imports `node:fs`
 * today) and `./browser` (no filesystem at all) — and a module is bundled only
 * if it is imported. `@vibeguard/sarif-adapter` established the pattern in
 * 0.3.0-β with `./node` → `provenance-node.js`, which reaches
 * `node:child_process` inside a package both extensions import.
 *
 * So this module is reachable ONLY through `@vibeguard/analyzer-core/node` (see
 * `node.ts`). It is not re-exported from `index.ts` or `browser.ts`, and must
 * not be: the point of the subpath is that every import site says "node" out
 * loud, so a browser-side import is a visible mistake rather than an invisible
 * one. Consumers today are `apps/cli` (via a re-export shim that keeps its own
 * import path stable) and `extensions/vscode`.
 *
 * REJECTED: a new workspace package (`@vibeguard/lockfile-reader`). It buys the
 * same isolation and costs a lockfile entry, an egress-scan target, a version to
 * keep in step with five others, and a closure check — for one file that only
 * ever has two consumers, both of which already depend on this package.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE MAY AND MAY NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - `packages/rules` stays free of I/O. `match()` is a pure function of one
 *    file's text; the four channels agree only because they share it, and the
 *    no-network CI job asserts that a rule reaches nothing outside its argument.
 *  - The analyzer receives a list of NAMES and nothing else — see
 *    `ScanRequest.declaredPackages` and `declared-veto.ts` for what it does with
 *    them, and for why "a name in a lockfile" is evidence at all. Reading and
 *    deciding stay separate: this file reads, the analyzer decides.
 *
 * ── SCOPE: ONE DIRECTORY, AND NOTHING ELSE ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Exactly one directory is searched — the target, or its parent when the target
 * is a single file — with the same rule the config-file discovery uses, so a
 * user who understands one understands the other.
 *
 * REJECTED: walking up to the repository root (what package managers and most
 * linters do). It is more likely to find a lockfile and it makes the tool's
 * behaviour unexplainable from the command line: `vibeguard ./src` would
 * silence findings because of a file four directories above `./src` that the
 * user never mentioned, and whether it did so would depend on where the
 * checkout happened to sit. A veto that deletes findings has to be predictable
 * from what was typed; "the lockfile next to what you scanned" is that, and
 * scanning the project root instead is the one-word fix when it is not.
 *
 * REJECTED: recursively collecting every lockfile under the target. Same
 * problem in the other direction, plus it makes an unrelated vendored fixture's
 * lockfile authoritative over the whole tree.
 *
 * WHICH DIRECTORY EACH CHANNEL PASSES IN is the channel's decision, not this
 * file's: the CLI passes what the user typed, and the editor passes the
 * workspace folder the document belongs to (the editor's analogue of a typed
 * target — see `extensions/vscode/src/runner.ts`). Both then get the identical
 * search, which is what makes the two channels agree.
 *
 * ── FAILURE DIRECTION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every failure path here returns FEWER names, never more, and says so out
 * loud. The asymmetry is deliberate and is the safety property of this file:
 * missing a name means a finding is reported that could have been vetoed (a
 * false positive — noisy, visible, arguable), while inventing a name means a
 * real finding disappears (a false negative — silent, invisible, and exactly
 * what an attacker who can write a lockfile would want). A parser that cannot
 * make sense of a file therefore yields nothing FROM THAT FILE and emits a
 * warning; it never yields a wildcard, and it never guesses.
