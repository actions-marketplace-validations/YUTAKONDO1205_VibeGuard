// This file's fixtures ARE secrets by construction — that is what it tests.
// The AWS key is Amazon's published example value and the GitHub token is an
// obvious fake; neither is a live credential. Rules named individually so the
// suppression cannot quietly widen.
//
// VG-SEC-003 was added when that rule stopped using `\b` before the keyword.
// `GH_TOKEN = '…'` was invisible to it for as long as the boundary was there —
// `_` is a word character, so no boundary ever existed between a prefix and
// `token` — and the whole point of the lookbehind that replaced it is that
// `OPENAI_API_KEY` and friends now match. This fixture is the first thing the
// widened rule finds in its own repository, which is the rule working.

const AWS_KEY = 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE';
// Deliberately an obvious fake, matching the convention already used in
// `rules.test.ts`. A realistic-looking `ghp_` token in a committed file trips
// GitHub's own push protection and blocks the push — and a secrets test that
// cannot be pushed is worth less than one with a boring fixture.

/**
 * Redaction has to hold at the OUTPUT boundary, not just in one field.
 *
 * The regression these tests pin: `maskSecret` recognised a secret only when it
 * was written as a quoted string literal. Quoting is a property of the source
 * syntax, not of whether a value is a credential, so the same AWS key survived
 * verbatim whenever it appeared in a `.env`, a YAML value, or as a rule's bare
 * `evidence` — and `snippet` is the field the SARIF adapter emits, so a scan
 * uploaded to GitHub code scanning republished the key it had just found.
