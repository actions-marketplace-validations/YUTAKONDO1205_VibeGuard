/**
 * D3 — the regex bounds, tested where they are actually visible to a user: on
 * the scan response.
 *
 * The unit tests in packages/rules/src/matcher-utils.test.ts cover the bounds
 * themselves. What can only be checked here is the pair of properties the bounds
 * were introduced to satisfy:
 *
 *   1. TRANSPARENCY — no bound fires on any input a real scan meets. A guard
 *      that trips on ordinary files is a silent false-negative generator, which
 *      is worse than the ReDoS it was added to prevent. This is asserted over
 *      the whole regression corpus, not over a hand-picked file, because the
 *      claim being made is about the corpus.
 *
 *   2. OBSERVABILITY — when a bound does fire, it reaches `degradations`, which
 *      every output channel surfaces. That is a channel of its own rather than
 *      `ruleErrors`, because a rule error means "the rule crashed and produced
 *      nothing" while a degradation means "the rule ran and reported findings,
 *      but not over the whole input" — and the renderer has to be able to say
 *      which. A bounded scan must never be indistinguishable from a clean one.
