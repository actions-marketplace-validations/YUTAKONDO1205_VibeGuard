// Semgrep `--json` report -> ExternalFinding[].
//
// ★★ THE FIELD INTERPRETATION IS NOT A NEW ONE
//
// `scripts/sec-transfer-semgrep.mjs` has been reading this format since the
// transfer experiment, and its three lines of extraction are the interpretation
// of record:
//
//     const f = rel(r.path ?? r.location?.path ?? '');
//     const line = Number(r.start?.line ?? r.start ?? 0);
//     const cid = String(r.check_id ?? '');
//
// A second parser that read `r.extra.lines` for the location, or took
// `r.end.line` as the anchor, or fell back to a different default, would give
// this project two different answers to "what did Semgrep say" — and the first
// person to notice would be a reviewer holding a paper table and a CLI output
// that disagree. So the fallback chain above is reproduced exactly, and
// `parser-parity.test.ts` runs both over the same 20 recorded results and asserts
// agreement on (check_id, path, line) for every one of them. That test also
// asserts those three lines still appear verbatim in the script, so an edit there
// breaks this package's build rather than silently forking the answer.
//
// The one place the two DO differ is the path base, and it is deliberate,
// explained on `AdapterOptions.rootDir`, and covered by its own test: the script
// reduces every path against `process.cwd()` because it only ever reads reports
// it generated itself in the repo root; this package reads reports the user
// generated somewhere unknown.
//
// ★ WHAT IS READ FROM `extra.metadata`, AND WHAT IS POINTEDLY NOT
//
// Read: `cwe` (carried, never used as a join key — see weakness-class.ts for the
// measurement that settled that), and `confidence`, which Semgrep's rule authors
// populate with LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH and which is the only confidence signal in the
// format.
//
// Not read: `impact`, `likelihood`, `subcategory`, `technology`, `references`,
// `source`, `shortlink`, `license`. Each is real and each would be a field this
// package promises to keep meaning something. `Finding` has nowhere to put them
// that a consumer reads, so carrying them would be storage without a reader.
//
// Not read, specifically: `extra.fix`. Semgrep ships autofix text and it is
// tempting to surface as a remediation. It is refused because
// `Finding.remediation` is rendered by the CLI as VibeGuard's advice, in
// VibeGuard's voice, and a fix string from a tool this process never ran would be
// presented as this project's recommendation.
//
// ★ CORRECTED 2026-08-03. This comment used to say the fixture's `extra.fix`
// values are the literal string "requires login" for several rules, and called
// that "the concrete reason, not a hypothetical one". That was FALSE, and the
// assertion beside it (`expect(FIXTURE_TEXT).toContain('"fix"')`) never checked
// it, so it stayed green while being wrong. Measured over all 20 results:
//   extra.fix   === "requires login"  →  0 / 20
//   extra.lines === "requires login"  → 20 / 20
// The redaction is real but it lands on `lines` and `fingerprint`, not on `fix`.
// The three non-null `extra.fix` values in the recording are genuine autofix
// text ("requests.get(..., verify=True)", "False", "crypto/rand"), which is the
// better argument anyway: they ARE usable advice, and printing them in
// VibeGuard's voice is precisely the misattribution this refuses.
//
// (Worth keeping: because `extra.lines` is redacted in all 20, the fixture
// contains no line of the scanned source at all.)

 * sorted report — i.e. the tool this process did not run would out-rank the tool
 * it did, systematically, on a severity scale it never used. Mapping to `high`
 * keeps the two comparable and leaves `critical` meaning what it means elsewhere
 * in this codebase: a VibeGuard rule decided it. `rawSeverity` carries the
