 * pragma or in `suppress[].rules`) is honoured at every severity by design — see
 * `SECURITY_JUDGEMENT_SEVERITIES` and `entryCovers` for why the escape hatch has
 * to stay open. What changes is only that using it is no longer *silent*: before
 * this, a scan output was byte-identical whether a critical finding never
 * existed or whether someone had written one line to erase it. That
 * indistinguishability is what made suppression usable as a hiding mechanism,
 * and it is the only thing removed here. An attacker can still suppress; they
 * can no longer suppress without leaving a countable trace in the artifact the
 * reviewer reads.
 *
 * `SuppressionOverride` is the complement of this type and the two must not be
 * confused. That one rides on a finding that SURVIVED a refused blanket
 * suppression; this one stands in for findings that did NOT survive an honoured
 * one.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the finding itself — no title, no snippet, no
 * line numbers. Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one.
 *  - Re-emitting the suppressed content would make suppression a no-op, which
 *    would break the legitimate use (the noise a team asked not to see would
 *    come back in a different column) and would guarantee the feature gets
 *    turned off wholesale, which is strictly worse for observability.
 *  - `ruleId` plus a line number IS the finding, near enough: a reader holding
 *    both can reconstruct what was hidden without the analyzer's help. The
 *    granularity therefore stops at the FILE. "VG-INJ-004 was silenced twice in
 *    src/db.ts by a pragma" is enough for a reviewer to go look, which is the
 *    entire job of this channel, and it is not enough to serve as a findings
 *    feed that bypasses the user's stated intent.

 *
 * A claim is an accusation, not evidence. Whoever says "there is an
 * authorization check here" — an assistant in its prose, a rule reading the
 * source, a fixer reporting its own edit — has created something that must be
 * proven, and has proven nothing. So:
 *
 *   * `state` is `NOT_OBSERVED` at birth and `crossExaminedAt` is absent;
 *   * only an observation at a layer OTHER than `claimantLayer` may set
 *     `state` to anything else, and it must record itself in
 *     `crossExaminedAt`;
 *   * therefore a claim can only ever add work. It cannot turn a screen green.
 *
 * That last line is the whole reason the type is shaped this way. The obvious
 * design — let a coding assistant annotate its output and believe the
 * annotation — makes the party being examined the examiner. The measured
 * behaviour of assistants is not good enough for that, and more to the point it
 * would not be good enough even if it were: the product exists because its user
 * cannot check the assistant's word, and a green tick sourced from that word
 * hands the user back exactly the question they could not answer.

 * Which severities carry a *security judgement*, i.e. a verdict a consumer acts
 * on rather than a piece of hygiene advice.
 *
 * This is the shared boundary behind every "utility may not overrule security"
 * enforcement point in the codebase. `SEVERITY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` (evaluation
 * ①c, packages/rules/src/confidence.ts) established the principle on the
 * *confidence* axis: a context downgrade is noise reduction, and noise reduction
 * must never be able to decide a security question, so the downgrade is bounded
 * for findings whose impact would be severe if real. The same principle applies
 * to every other mechanism that can make a finding quieter — suppression
 * (`vibeguard:disable-*` pragmas and the config `suppress` paths) and the
 * truncation that happens when a rule hits its per-file match cap. Rather than
 * let each of those re-derive "which findings are severe enough to protect",
 * they all ask this predicate, so the policy is one decision with several
 * enforcement points instead of several policies that drift apart.
 *
 * The line is drawn at `medium`, following the precedent set by the confidence
 * floor rather than inventing a second boundary. Two observations put it there:
 *
 *  - `medium` is above the default actionable threshold. A consumer running the
 *    default configuration acts on medium findings, so a mechanism that can
 *    silence them silently removes something that would otherwise have been
 *    acted on. That is the property that matters, and it does not change
 *    between the confidence axis and the suppression axis.
 *  - Measurement on the confidence axis (item ①c) showed the un-bounded
 *    `medium` band was where the disguise actually worked: a real finding was
 *    pushed below the line just as effectively as it would have been in the
 *    `high` band without a gate. There is no reason to expect the suppression
 *    axis to behave differently, and the corpus generator for the b3 attack
 *    (scripts/sec-b3-gen-corpus.mjs, the suppress-wildcard arm) is explicitly
 *    severity-agnostic — it fires a blanket `vibeguard:disable-file` and takes
 *    whatever it happens to cover. A boundary that stopped at `high` would hand
 *    that arm the entire `medium` band for free.
 *
 * `low` and `info` deliberately stay outside. These are the bands where the
 * findings are advisory (style, hygiene, "consider…") and where blanket
 * suppression is the legitimate day-to-day operation that keeps VibeGuard
 * usable on a real codebase — a team that has decided it does not care about a
 * class of `low` findings must be able to say so once and move on. Excluding
 * them is not a weaker application of the principle; it is the principle,
 * which is about *security* judgements specifically. Utility mechanisms keep
 * full authority over the bands that carry no security verdict.
 *
 * Deliberately a total `Record` rather than a set or a `Partial`, for the same
 * reason `SEVERITY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` is: adding a severity to the schema must
 * break this build and force an explicit decision about which side of the line
 * it falls on, instead of silently defaulting to "not a security judgement" —
 * the quiet direction is the unsafe one.
