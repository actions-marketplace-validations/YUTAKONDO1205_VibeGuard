 * ALLOWLIST of line-comment syntax, keyed by language.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for "does a comment start here?": both
 * `isCommentLine` below (whose result makes `runRegex({ skipCommentLines })`
 * DROP a match) and `isInDocstringOrBlockComment` in confidence.ts consume it,
 * so a language is classified once, in one place.
 *
 * It is an allowlist, and that direction is the point. A language with no entry
 * — an unrecognised extension, a file whose language could not be detected —
 * gets `EMPTY_SPEC`: nothing is a comment, so no match is dropped. Failing that
 * way yields at worst a false positive (a finding on a line that really was a
 * comment), never a silent false negative. The dropped match never reaches the
 * analyzer's confidence chokepoint, so the severity gate cannot bound the
 * mistake; a noisy finding, by contrast, is visible and can be triaged. The old
 * blocklist defaulted to "`#` starts a comment" for unknown languages, which let
 * a single unrecognised extension erase findings before anything could see them.
 *
 * ADDING A LANGUAGE: add it to `EXT_TO_LANGUAGE` *and* to this map. Forgetting
 * the map is a compile error (`satisfies Record<KnownLanguage, …>`); forgetting
 * either side is caught by the sync test that compares the two. If one somehow
 * ships anyway, the runtime behavior is `EMPTY_SPEC` — fail-safe.
 *
 * Non-obvious choices, and why:
 *
 * - `json` gets `//`. Strict JSON has no comments, but no valid JSON token can
 *   begin with `/` either, so a line whose first non-space characters are `//`
 *   is syntactically impossible in conforming JSON. Listing it therefore costs
 *   nothing and correctly drops comments in the JSONC dialects we actually meet
 *   (tsconfig.json and friends).
 * - `php` gets `//` and `#`, minus the `#[` exclusion. PHP 8 attributes
 *   (`#[Route('/admin')]`) are executed syntax and must not be swallowed, while
 *   `# comment` is a genuine comment. `# [x]` keeps its comment status: the
 *   space means it does not start with `#[`.
 * - `html` is empty. Its only comment syntax is `<!-- -->`, which is a
 *   multi-line construct this line-oriented predicate does not model (a known
 *   limitation, unchanged here). `#` in an HTML file is a CSS id selector or a
 *   private class field inside an inline `<script>`, never a comment.
 * - `sql` gets `#` (MySQL) and `--`. The `--` test is a naive `startsWith`,
 *   whereas MySQL requires whitespace after `--` for it to be a comment. So
 *   `--payload` — which MySQL executes — is classified as a comment and its
 *   match dropped. KNOWN RESIDUAL GAP, deliberately left: tightening it is out
 *   of scope for this change.
 *
 * Note the map is not exported raw: callers go through `getLineCommentSpec` so
 * the unknown-language fallback cannot be bypassed.

 * D3 — the input-length bound. Content longer than this is TRUNCATED before any
 * pattern runs; see `runRegex` for why truncation and not skipping.
 *
 * THIS IS A BACKSTOP, NOT THE PRIMARY REDOS DEFENCE — and it did not start that
 * way. The first version of D3 leaned on this cap to bound ReDoS, and
 * MEASUREMENT REFUTED THAT: the worst rule was super-linear on inputs far INSIDE
 * any cap large enough to keep scanning real files, inside a single
 * uninterruptible `exec`. What actually fixed it was rewriting the patterns
 * themselves (L1): bounding every whitespace quantifier so none can span an
 * arbitrary run of blank lines, and leaving no two variable-length runs
 * adjacent. After that rewrite the whole all-rules canonical pass costs single-
 * digit milliseconds at every size up to 1 MB, where it was previously quadratic.
 * `redos-invariant.test.ts` is what keeps it that way.
 *
 * (The rule-by-rule before/after numbers, the attack shapes and the derivation
 * live in security-experiment/, not here. This file ships to every user,
 * including ones still on an older release; a precise recipe for which rule
 * breaks on which input does not belong in it.)
 *
 * WHY THE CAP STAYS, AND WHY 50_000. Its job changed rather than disappeared. The
 * binding cost is now FINDING ASSEMBLY — snippet extraction and remediation, ~1.7 ms
 * per finding — which grows with how many findings a file contains, not with
 * regex complexity. On a deliberately finding-dense input a full scan at the cap
 * measures ~1.3 s, inside DESIGN §11.1's 3 s single-file budget; at 1 MB the same
 * shape would produce tens of thousands of findings and blow it by an order of
 * magnitude. 50_000 keeps that worst case inside the contract, and is still ~7×
 * the largest file in the regression corpus (6.7 KB) so the bound stays invisible
 * to real scans (asserted in redos-bounds.test.ts, not hoped for).
 *
 * The cap ALSO remains the only runtime defence against an injected rule set
 * (`AnalyzerOptions.rules`), which never passes the CI invariant — a
 * caller-supplied catastrophic pattern is bounded in input length even though it
 * cannot be bounded in time.
 *
 * Raising it is now a question about finding-assembly cost, not backtracking:
 * bound that separately and this could go up.
 *
 * THE COST OF THIS CHOICE IS REAL. Source files between 50 KB and the
 * file-scanner's 1 MB ceiling are now scanned only in part. That is a false
 * negative, which is why truncation is always REPORTED (see `runRegex`) instead
 * of silently applied: a partial scan must never read as a clean one.
 *
 * This bound is DETERMINISTIC — it depends on `content.length` and nothing else.
 * That is the whole reason it, and not the deadline below, is what decides which
 * matches come back. Same input, same result, on every host and every channel;
 * E1's four-channel agreement cannot be broken by a fast or slow machine.

 * pass is counted, so a 1 s per-call budget permits a 168 s scan while every
 * individual call stays "within budget". The budget has to span the unit the
 * user actually waits for, which is the scan. `captureRegexBoundaries` opens
 * that span; calls made outside one fall back to this value as a per-call
 * budget, which is the safe reading for a rule invoked directly in a test.
 *
 * IT EXISTS FOR INJECTED RULES, NOT FOR THE SHIPPED ONES. After L1 the shipped
 * rules are linear — the whole canonical pass over all 47 measures ~3 ms even at
 * 1 MB — so they cannot come close to this budget, and `redos-invariant.test.ts`
 * keeps it so. What CAN reach it is a rule set supplied through
 * `AnalyzerOptions.rules`, which never passes the CI invariant; a caller-supplied
 * backtracking pattern is a live possibility and this is the only thing that ends
 * it. Two consequences, both intended:
 *
 * - On every input a real scan meets, the comparison is always false, so results
 *   stay DETERMINISTIC and E1's four-channel agreement cannot be broken by one
 *   host being slower than another. Timing becomes load-bearing only for inputs
 *   that are already pathological.
 * - The budget counts REGEX time, not wall-clock (see below), so a scan is never
 *   declared degraded because it happened to find a lot of findings.
 *
 * KNOWN AND UNAVOIDABLE LIMIT — this is not a hard timeout.
 * `RegExp.prototype.exec` is synchronous and cannot be interrupted, so a single
 * `exec` that enters catastrophic backtracking runs to completion regardless of
 * this value; a deadline checked between matches cannot preempt the match in
 * progress. This is not hypothetical: it is the measured reason the original
 * "input cap + per-match timeout" design failed, because a pattern that matches
 * NOTHING calls `exec` once and neither bound is ever consulted. Only rewriting
 * the pattern (L1) fixed it. For an injected rule that cannot be rewritten, the
 * honest position is that the input cap bounds its INPUT but nothing bounds its
 * TIME; true preemption would need a worker per scan, making the synchronous
 * rule API async and diverging the four channels, and that trade is declined
 * deliberately. Load-time screening of injected patterns is the right fix and is

 * VG-EMB 17f — lexical balanced-block extraction, no parser.
 *
 * 17c REJECTED tree-sitter with the promise that structural rules (an ISR body,
 * a function scope) can be written LEXICALLY. This is where that promise is
 * kept: given the offset of a match (e.g. `ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)`), return the
 * `{ … }` block that follows it, so a rule can scan the BODY rather than the
 * whole file. If this needs to grow into an expression parser to work, the
 * rejection was wrong — so it is kept deliberately small.
 *
 * The scan is a single forward pass with a five-state machine — code, `//`
 * comment, `/* *\/` comment, `"` string, `'` char — honoring `\` escapes, so a
 * brace inside a string or comment (`"}"`, `// }`) does NOT count. That
 * distinction is the whole reason this cannot be a bare `indexOf('}')`.
 *
 * LINEAR by construction (no regex, one pass, bounded by `maxBodyLength`), so it
 * stays inside the D3 ReDoS contract even when callers overlap many heads.
 *
 * FAILS QUIET. No opening brace within `maxHeadGap`, or the block never balances
 * within `maxBodyLength` / before EOF, returns `null` — never a truncated body.
 * An unbalanced block is a parse failure, and a rule anchored to a guessed body
 * would report findings on garbage; `null` means "no detection", the safe side.
 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUAL: C++ raw strings `R"(…)"` are not modelled (their `"` closes
 * the string state early), so a raw string containing unbalanced braces inside
 * a scanned block can desync the count and yield `null`. That is the fail-quiet
 * direction (a missed detection, never a wrong one), and modelling user-defined
 * raw delimiters is exactly the parser this helper refuses to become.

 * snippets, `vibeguard:disable-line` lookups, SARIF regions, the VS Code Quick
 * Fix insertion point) is identity-mapped to the source by construction. A face
 * that breaks that mapping puts a translation seam in front of all of them.
 *
