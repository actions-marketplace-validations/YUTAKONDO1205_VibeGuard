/**
 * Context-window confidence adjustment (evaluation E6).
 *
 * VibeGuard's findings carry two orthogonal axes: `severity` (impact if real,
 * static per rule) and `confidence` (certainty the match is real). docs/DESIGN.ja.md
 * §13.3 defines confidence as the false-positive control knob — Medium means
 * "pattern matched but the surrounding context may be safe", Low means
 * "heuristic, needs human review". Until now no rule ever set a per-match
 * confidence, so every finding inherited the rule's static `defaultConfidence`
 * and the axis was effectively dead. This module makes confidence *contextual*:
 * it inspects the small window around each match and DOWN-RANKS findings that
 * sit in a context where the matched pattern is very unlikely to be a live
 * vulnerability — a comment, a docstring / block comment, or a test fixture.
 *
 * Policy decision (see paper): this is **downgrade-only**. We never raise
 * confidence, because "this match is on a real production path" cannot be
 * decided reliably from a regex window and a wrong guess manufactures false
 * `high`-confidence findings. Lowering confidence in a demonstrably non-executed
 * context is, by contrast, safe and directly reduces false-positive noise.
 *
 * The adjustment is applied centrally in the analyzer (the single
 * `m.confidence ?? contextConfidence(...)` chokepoint), so it covers every rule
 * uniformly. Rules whose detection signal *is* the comment itself
 * (VG-AUTH-002 "TODO near security", VG-QUAL-009 "not for production") opt out
 * with `contextConfidence: 'off'`; for them a comment must not lower confidence.
 *
 * ## The severity gate: downgrades are utility, not a security verdict
 *
 * A false-positive filter is also an attack surface. Someone who controls the
 * file can wrap a *real* vulnerability in a docstring, or park it under a
 * `tests/` path, and ride the downgrade below whatever confidence threshold the
 * consumer acts on — hiding the finding in plain sight without touching the
 * detection rule at all. The defence is a policy statement rather than a better
 * heuristic, because any heuristic sharp enough to see through the disguise is
 * also sharp enough to be fooled by the next one: **a context downgrade is a
 * noise-reduction convenience and must never decide a security question.**
 * `SEVERITY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` therefore bounds how far this module may lower a
 * finding whose *impact* would be severe if real, no matter how convincing the
 * surrounding context looks. Severity is static per rule and attacker-controlled
 * text cannot move it, which is exactly what makes it usable as the bound.
 *
 * The bound covers `medium` too, and for the same reason: measurement showed the
 * un-floored `medium` band letting a wrapped finding fall all the way to `low`,
 * i.e. below the default actionable threshold, so the disguise worked there
 * exactly as well as it would have on `high` without the gate. What differs is
 * only how much room the bound leaves, not whether the bound exists — see the
 * per-severity table below.
 *
 * The resolved rank is:
 *
 *     effectiveRank = max( RANK[base] - Σsteps, 0, min( RANK[base], FLOOR_RANK[severity] ) )
 *
 * The inner `min(RANK[base], …)` is load-bearing. Read the floor loosely as
 * "clamp confidence up to at least `high`" and you break the downgrade-only
 * invariant the whole module rests on: a `critical` rule whose
 * `defaultConfidence` is `medium`, matched in a test file, would be RAISED
 * medium → high — this module would start manufacturing precisely the false
 * `high`-confidence findings the policy above forbids. The floor is a *bound on
 * downgrading*, never a promotion device; clamping it to `base` first makes
 * `result <= base` hold by construction, for every input, no case analysis
 * needed.
 *
 * A consequence worth naming: `RANK['high'] = 2` is the top rung of the ladder,
 * so `min(RANK[base], 2) === RANK[base]` for every `base`. `floor: 'high'` is
 * therefore *exactly equivalent* to "critical/high findings take no context
 * downgrade at all" — the two ways of stating the gate ("clamp at high" and
 * "don't downgrade") collapse into the same function. `null` means no gate, i.e.
 * the item ① behaviour above, unchanged.
 *
 * `floor: 'medium'` is the genuinely intermediate case, and the difference from
 * `'high'` matters when reading the code: it is NOT "no downgrade". `medium` sits
 * one rung below the top, so a `high`-confidence finding still loses a rung to
 * context — the downgrade remains visible and still quiets triage — but the
 * result cannot cross below `medium`, the default actionable threshold. The gate
 * bounds how far the disguise carries; it does not switch the downgrade off.
 *
 * ## Precedence: `off` short-circuits before the gate
 *
 * `mode === 'off'` returns `base` and never reaches the gate. The two are not
 * competing axes: `off` is strictly stronger, meaning "zero downgrade at any
 * severity", which already satisfies every possible floor. For VG-AUTH-002 /
 * VG-QUAL-009 the comment IS the detection signal, so a comment must not lower
 * confidence whatever the rule's severity happens to be.
 *
 * ## `m.confidence` bypasses this module entirely
 *
 * The analyzer resolves `m.confidence ?? contextConfidence(...)`, so a rule that
 * returns a per-match confidence skips the downgrade layer *and* this gate.
 * That is intended: `m.confidence` is a rule asserting certainty from its own
 * domain knowledge of the match, a separate channel from the generic
 * heuristics here — and therefore from their attack surface. The trade is
 * explicit: **a rule that sets `m.confidence` takes on the gate's
 * responsibility itself.** No rule sets it today, and the analyzer pins the
 * bypass with a test so that the day one starts, it surfaces in review.

 * why this exists, why `high` here reads as "never downgraded", and why
 * `medium` does not.
 *
 * `critical` and `high` are floored at `high`: when a finding would be severe if
 * real, "it looks like it's in a comment" is not evidence we are willing to act
 * on, because that is the one signal an attacker can forge for free. Those
 * findings therefore take no context downgrade at all.
 *
 * `medium` is floored at `medium`, which is a weaker bound on purpose. A
 * `medium`-severity finding is still something a consumer acts on at the default
 * threshold, so letting context push it to `low` hands the same free hiding place
 * back — a real finding wrapped in a docstring simply disappears below the line.
 * Flooring at `medium` closes that: `high → medium` still happens (the noise
 * reduction the context layer exists for survives, one rung of it), but the
 * finding cannot be buried. Proportionality, not a lesser principle: the bound is
 * set at the threshold that severity implies, not at the top of the ladder.
 *
 * `low` and `info` stay `null`, deliberately. These are the bands where the
 * false-positive reduction is worth the most and the impact if the downgrade is
 * abused is smallest, so they keep the unmodified item ① behaviour and take the
 * full downgrade. Note also that writing `'low'` here would be *inert*:
 * `RANK['low'] = 0` is the bottom rung, so `max(rank, min(RANK[base], 0)) ===
 * rank` for every input — a `'low'` floor and `null` are the same function.
 * `null` says so honestly instead of implying a gate that does nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately a total `Record` rather than a `Partial`: a new severity in the
 * schema must break this build and force an explicit decision, instead of
 * silently defaulting to "ungated" — the quiet direction is the unsafe one.

/**
 * Decide whether the match on line `lineNumber` (1-based) sits *inside* a

 * was opened on an earlier line. This is a deliberately small heuristic state
 * machine: it scans every line strictly before the match line, toggling block
 * state. It is the complement to `isCommentLine` (which only catches whole-line
 * `//`/`#` comments) and to `runRegex({ skipCommentLines })` (same limitation).
 *
 * Both answer "what opens a line comment in this language?" out of the one
 * `LINE_COMMENT_SPECS` allowlist in matcher-utils, reached through
 * `getLineCommentSpec`, so a language is classified identically here and there.
 * They differ only in *where* they ask. `isCommentLine` asks at the first
 * non-whitespace character, because it decides whether a whole line is a
 * comment. The scan below asks `lineCommentStartsAt(line, k, spec)` at every
 * position `k` it reaches in `normal` state, because it must also handle
 * TRAILING comments: in `x = 1  # opens """` the `#` has to swallow the rest of
 * the line, or the `"""` phantom-opens a docstring over the code that follows.
 * Dropping the line-start predicate in here would break precisely that, which is
 * why the positional form exists.
 *
 * The branch is map-driven for every prefix, `//` included. Hard-coding `//` as
 * unconditional (as this scanner once did) corrupts languages where it is an
 * operator, not a comment: Python's `x = a // 2 + "s…` would have the rest of the
 * line skipped and the string state silently lost.
 *
 * A language with no allowlist entry gets the empty spec, so nothing swallows and
 * the scan reads the whole line as code. The direction of that fallback differs
 * from `isCommentLine`'s: there an empty spec can only cost a false positive,
 * whereas here an unswallowed `/*` sitting inside what really was a comment can
 * phantom-open a block and wrongly down-rank the lines after it. That residual is
 * bounded by construction — the worst case is a `docstring` down-rank, which is
 * applied at the analyzer chokepoint and clamped there by
 * `SEVERITY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` — whereas a wrongly dropped match reaches neither.
 *
 * Two deliberate, *safe-direction* limitations (they only ever WITHHOLD a
 * down-rank, never wrongly apply one, so they cannot demote a true positive):
 *  - Same-line open: a pattern on the very line that *opens* a triple quote /
 *    block is not treated as in-block (we scan lines strictly before), so it
 *    keeps its default confidence.
 *  - Close line: if the match line also *closes* the enclosing block (contains
 *    the closing `"""`/`'''`/`*\/`), the payload may be real code after the
 *    closer, so we conservatively return `false` (keep default confidence)
 *    rather than risk down-ranking executable code on a block-closing line.
 * Both err toward NOT down-ranking, preserving the "no collateral damage"
 * property at the cost of occasionally missing a down-rank in these rare cases.
