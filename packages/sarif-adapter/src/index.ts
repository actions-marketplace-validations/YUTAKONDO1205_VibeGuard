 * The file's standing discipline is that an absent key and a key holding

 * enumerating them — hence conditional spread everywhere above. Provenance adds
 * a case that discipline does not settle on its own: an observation that was
 * MADE and found nothing.
 *
 * It is dropped, and the argument is epistemic rather than cosmetic. The
 * collector's claim limit says outright that most AI-assisted work carries no
 * marker, so "we read 500 commits and found no declaration" tells a reader
 * exactly as much about whether an assistant wrote this code as "we never
 * looked" does: nothing. The two states are informationally identical, so
 * giving them two different JSON shapes would invite a consumer to treat one of
 * them as a negative result — an `observedAuthorshipMarkers: []` rendered as "no
 * AI involvement detected" is the single most likely misreading of this whole
 * feature, and it becomes possible the moment the empty array is emitted.
 *
 * This is the one place where the "absent ≠ empty" rule points the other way,
 * and it points that way because here the two really do mean the same thing.
 *
 * The check is on the marker list rather than on `provenance` being supplied,
 * because `ToSarifOptions` is public: a caller can hand in an observation it
 * built itself, and the guarantee has to hold for that caller too.
