# Change Log

All notable changes to the VibeGuard VS Code extension are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.6] - 2026-08-18

**This extension is the surface this release is about.** Engine `0.3.2` → `0.3.3`.

**Fewer false positives on hallucinated dependencies.** `VG-AISC-001` reports an import
whose package looks like something an AI invented. The command-line tool has always
checked that guess against the project's **lockfile** and dropped the finding when the
lockfile declares the package — but that check lived inside the CLI, and this extension
never ran it. The result was the worst possible split: the same project reported clean by
`vibeguard` on the terminal and flagged in the editor, on a dependency that is genuinely
installed and genuinely declared.

The editor now reads the lockfile too. A `VG-AISC-001` your lockfile vouches for no longer
appears in the Problems panel.

**Where you will notice it — and where you will not.** This matters more than it sounds,
because on the extension's DEFAULT settings the answer is "nowhere".

`VG-AISC-001` is a **medium**-severity rule, and scan-on-save defaults to `fast`, which
runs only critical- and high-severity rules. So an on-save scan never reported these
findings in the first place, and does not start now.

| How you scan | Mode | Changed by this release? |
|---|---|---|
| `VibeGuard: Scan File` | `standard` | **Yes** — refuted findings are gone |
| `VibeGuard: Scan Selection` | `standard` | **Yes** |
| On save, default settings | `fast` | No — the rule does not run in `fast` |
| On save, `vibeguard.scanOnSaveMode: standard` | `standard` | **Yes** |

Nothing else moves: no other rule changed, no severity changed, and a file in any language
that was clean on save before is clean on save now. If you were relying on these findings
to notice a lockfile you had not updated, that is what the CLI's `--fail-on` gate is for —
the editor now agrees with it instead of contradicting it.

**Which lockfile, and what happens without one.** The lockfile is looked up in the
**workspace folder** you opened — that is the editor's analogue of the path a CLI user
names, and it is where `npm install` writes. A file open outside every workspace folder
falls back to its own directory, which is what `vibeguard path/to/that/file` would do. The
reader does not walk up the tree hunting for a lockfile, deliberately: the CLI does not
either, and the two channels agreeing on which file counts as evidence is the whole point
of this change. With **no** lockfile there is no evidence either way, so nothing is vetoed
and behaviour is exactly as it was in `0.3.5` — the veto declines rather than guesses.

**What a vetoed finding does not mean.** The lockfile proves the name RESOLVED — a package
manager asked a registry and the registry answered. It does not prove the package is
trustworthy. Slopsquatting works by registering the hallucinated name, and once someone has
installed it the name is in the registry and in the lockfile, and it is vetoed here. The
veto removes a finding about *whether the package exists*, which was the only thing
`VG-AISC-001` ever claimed.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-06

No change to this extension's own code. The analyzer engine moves `0.3.1` → `0.3.2`, so a
**C or C++ file may report two findings it did not report before**: `VG-MEM-006` (a secret
buffer cleared with a `memset` the compiler is allowed to delete) and `VG-AUTH-008`
(authorization decided by an `assert`, which `NDEBUG` removes). Files in every other
language are unaffected — a file that was clean on save before is clean on save now.

Both rules are medium/high severity with medium confidence, so on the editor's default
`fast` mode they surface the same way any other C/C++ finding does.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-08-04

No change to this extension's own code, and none to what it reports on save. Analyzer engine is
unchanged at `0.3.1`, so a file that was clean on save before is clean on save now.

0.3.4 is mostly a remediation-side release: it narrows what the CLI's `--fix` will write and
makes `--fail-on` apply in fix mode. Neither is reachable from the editor — this extension's
Quick Fixes insert a `vibeguard:disable-line` comment or display a finding's remediation text,
and it never applies a deterministic fixer.

**One thing you will see**, because the extension shows remediation prose: `VG-EMB-020` no
longer suggests `#define DEBUG 0` as a paste-ready fix. Setting the flag to `0` only disables a
debug path that reads its VALUE; where the code tests whether it is DEFINED, a zero is still a
definition and the path still compiles. The remediation now says so and leads with dropping the
define from release builds instead.

The cross-file analysis that 0.3.4 promotes to beta (`0.3.0-alpha.1` → `0.3.0-beta.3`, four
rules → eleven) is **not** part of the on-save scan; it is opt-in behind the CLI's
`--include-design-smells`. If your editor and your CI disagree about a design smell, that flag
is why, and it is the intended difference rather than drift.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-29

No change to this extension. The repository releases every channel under one tool version, and
0.3.3 fixes the **Chrome** extension manifest version that blocked its 0.3.2 submission.
This build is 0.3.2 with the version number moved. Analyzer engine is unchanged at `0.3.1`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-29

Analyzer engine moves to `0.3.1`, so **what this extension reports changes** —
see the root CHANGELOG for the full list. Two fixes are specific to the editor:

### Fixed

- **The suppression Quick Fix no longer corrupts the file it suppresses in.**
  Comment syntax was `#` for nine languages and `//` for everything else, and
  the provider is registered on every file type. Several rules are
  language-agnostic (`VG-CRYPTO-003` matches an `http://` URL in any text), so
  findings do appear in JSON, CSS, HTML and PowerShell — and accepting the fix in
  a `.json` file left a document `JSON.parse` rejects. Comment style is now
  per-language, falling back to a block comment where there is no line comment
  (CSS, HTML) and withholding the fix entirely for strict JSON, which has no
  comment syntax at all.
- **A rule that crashed used to leave the file green.** `ruleErrors` was never
  read, so a rule dying contributed no findings and looked exactly like a rule
  finding nothing. Each broken rule now raises a line-1 Warning, through the same
  channel already used for partial scans and for the same stated reason: an
  incomplete scan must not look like a clean one.

### Changed

- The README's rule count said **30**; there are **71**.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-28

No change to this extension. The repository releases every channel under one
tool version, and `0.3.1` fixes the **Chrome** extension's icon; this build is
`0.3.0` with the version number moved. Analyzer engine is unchanged at `0.3.0`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-28

> The extension version jumps `0.1.3` → `0.3.0` in this file because the `0.2.0`
> release was recorded only in the repository-level
> [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), not here. Everything in `0.2.0` is in this
> build too.

### Added
- Each finding's confidence is now visible: diagnostics end with
  `(confidence: …)` in the Problems panel and on hover, and the findings tree
  shows it in the row's tooltip. Confidence reflects how sure the analyzer is
  that a match is real — it does not change a finding's severity, and nothing
  is filtered out of the view.
- New rules from analyzer engine `0.3.0`, which the extension picks up without
  any UI change: the single-file security design smells (`VG-SMELL-003` /
  `VG-SMELL-004` / `VG-SMELL-012`), the hallucinated-dependency rule
  (`VG-AISC-001`), and prototype-polluting merges (`VG-INJ-020`). Plus the
  C/C++/Arduino embedded rules from engine `0.2.1` (`VG-MEM` / `VG-EMB` /
  `VG-RTOS`), which never reached a published build before now.
- A match can now escalate its own severity (e.g. a role check against a literal
  `"admin"`), so the same rule may show as a warning in one file and an error in
  another.

### Not included
- The cross-file analysis added in `0.3.0` (`--include-design-smells`,
  `VG-SMELL-010` and friends) is **CLI / GitHub Action only**. The extension scans
  the file in front of you and stays single-file by design; a CI packaging check
  fails the build if cross-file code ever reaches this bundle.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- `engines.vscode` raised from `^1.85.0` to `^1.120.0` to match the
  `@types/vscode@^1.120.0` dev-dependency. Users on older VS Code releases
  should stay on `v0.1.1` until they can update VS Code.

### Fixed
- Marketplace packaging — `v0.1.2` failed to publish because `vsce package`
  rejected the engines/types mismatch. `v0.1.3` is the first successfully
  shipped build of the v0.1.2 OK-state UX work (Findings welcome view,
  status-bar indicator, scan-file toast, severity colour tokens).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Findings view welcome state** — when there are no findings, the
  `VibeGuard Findings` panel now shows `✓ No security findings.` plus
  one-click `Scan Current File` and `Scan Selection` actions, instead of a
  blank panel.
- **Status-bar item** — a new shield indicator in the right status bar
  reports the active file's verdict at a glance:
  - `VibeGuard: ✓ No issues` (green) when clean,
  - `VibeGuard: N issues` with warning/error background when findings exist,
  - `VibeGuard: –` when the file has not been scanned yet.
  Clicking it focuses the Findings view.
- **Scan-File result toast** — `VibeGuard: Scan File` now confirms its run
  with either `✓ no issues found.` or a finding count, matching the existing
  selection-scan behaviour.
- **Custom color tokens** — `vibeguard.ok` (#2e7d32), `vibeguard.issue`
  (#856404), `vibeguard.critical` (#c62828) drive the tree-view icons and
  status-bar foreground colours. Themes and
  `workbench.colorCustomizations` can override them.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Command `VibeGuard: Export Findings (SARIF / JSON)` — exports the workspace's
  accumulated findings to a `.sarif` (v2.1.0) or `.json` file via the standard
  save dialog. Format is chosen by file extension.

### Changed
- Bundled rule catalogue now includes the new framework-misconfig rules
  (Django/Flask/Express) and CRYPTO rules extended to PHP/Ruby/Java/Go/C#.

### Fixed
- `--ignore` is now honoured in CLI diff scans (shared bundled analyzer),
  matching whole-file scan behaviour.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-09

First public release on the Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Added
- On-save scan (`fast` mode by default; configurable via `vibeguard.scanOnSaveMode`).
- Manual scan command `VibeGuard: Scan File` (always `standard` mode).
- Manual scan command `VibeGuard: Scan Selection` (also wired into the editor
  right-click menu when text is selected).
- VS Code Diagnostics surface with severity → Error / Warning / Information
  mapping derived from the analyzer's `severity` field.
- Findings tree view in the Explorer side bar (`VibeGuard Findings`).
- Settings:
  - `vibeguard.scanOnSave` — toggle save-time scanning (default: on).
  - `vibeguard.scanOnSaveMode` — `fast` | `standard` (default: `fast`).
- Bundled rule catalogue (30 rules across injection / auth / secrets / crypto /
  AI-quality), shared with the VibeGuard CLI and GitHub Action so verdicts stay
  consistent across editor, browser, and CI.

### Notes
- All analysis runs locally. The extension makes no network requests.
- Workspace-wide diff scan is tracked for an upcoming release.
