// esbuild driver for the VibeGuard CLI.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
//
// The CLI is not published to npm — that decision is permanent and is asserted
// by `check-packaging-invariants.mjs` invariant 2 (`private: true`). It ships as
// the tarball `release.yml` attaches to the GitHub Release. But that tarball was
// produced from a `tsc` build whose `dist/index.js` still began with
// `import … from '@vibeguard/analyzer-core'`, and `apps/cli/package.json` listed
// six `@vibeguard/*` packages as runtime `dependencies`. None of those names
// exists on any registry — deliberately, permanently — so
// `npm i vibeguard-cli-0.3.5.tgz` could not resolve them and the artefact the
// README points users at was uninstallable.
//
// Bundling is what makes the tarball self-contained: every workspace package the
// CLI reaches is inlined into `dist/index.js`, the manifest declares no runtime
// dependencies, and `npm i <tarball>` needs nothing from a registry. The
// manifest change and this file are two halves of ONE fix — bundling without
// moving the dependencies leaves the tarball broken, and moving them without
// bundling leaves it unrunnable.
//
// ── OUTPUT SHAPE IS LOAD-BEARING ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `dist/index.js` is not a name this file may choose. Every consumer in the
// repository invokes that exact path — `action.yml`, `security-scan.yml` (13
// call sites), `no-network-assert.yml`, the root `scan` script and the README —
// and none of them goes through the `bin` shim. A rename here silently breaks
// the Action, which is the channel with the most users and the least visible
// failure.
//
// ── ONE FILE, NOT CODE SPLITTING: THE LAZY-IMPORT DECISION ──────────────────
//
// `src/index.ts` has three deliberate dynamic imports, each carrying a comment
// that says the point is NOT to pay for a heavy path most runs never take:
//
//   :199  @vibeguard/analysis-graph      cross-file analysis   --include-design-smells
//   :252  @vibeguard/external-adapters   SAST ensemble         --ensemble
//   :403  @vibeguard/sarif-adapter/node  git provenance        --format sarif
//
// Bundling could destroy that in two different ways, so the question was asked
// deliberately rather than assumed away.
//
//   (a) Hoisting. If the bundler turned `await import(x)` into a static import,
//       every `vibeguard --help` would evaluate the cross-file rule table.
//       esbuild does NOT do this: an inlined module becomes an `__esm(...)` init
//       closure and the call site becomes
//       `await Promise.resolve().then(() => (init_x(), x_exports))`. Verified in
//       the emitted bundle — all three sites have exactly that shape, and
//       `assertLazyBoundaries()` below re-verifies it on every build, so a
//       future esbuild that changes its mind fails the BUILD rather than
//       silently discarding the property. EVALUATION laziness is preserved.
//
//   (b) Parse cost. A single file makes node read and parse ~655 KB even for
//       `--help`. `splitting: true` would avoid that by emitting the deferred
//       packages as separate chunks node only opens on demand. So it was built
//       both ways and timed rather than argued about.
//
// MEASURED on this machine (node v24.14.1, Windows, `--help`, 9 runs each,
// best / median wall clock including process spawn):
//
//   tsc output, 12 files, analyzer-core loaded eagerly     90.1 ms / 94.6 ms
//   single-file bundle, 655 KB                             57.5 ms / 61.3 ms
//   split bundle, 6 files (index 54 KB + 5 chunks)         63.8 ms / 71.2 ms
//
// Splitting is SLOWER here, not faster: node pays more to open and link six ES
// modules than to parse one larger file, and V8's lazy compilation means the
// unreferenced ~600 KB is never fully compiled anyway. It would also cost three
// content-hashed chunk names that change on every build (churning the tarball)
// and make `bin` depend on sibling files rather than one artefact.
//
// ★ AND THE HONEST HALF OF THE MEASUREMENT, which cuts against the assertion
// below rather than for it. The three lazy imports were deliberately hoisted
// into static ones and re-timed: 58.7 ms / 62.5 ms — indistinguishable from the
// 57.5 ms / 59.6 ms the lazy build gives. At 0.3.5's package sizes the laziness
// buys nothing measurable, because V8 compiles function bodies on first call
// whether or not esbuild wrapped the module.
//
// The assertion is kept anyway, and the reason is not the number today. It is
// that `analysis-graph` is a 0.3.0-α skeleton — `check-packaging-invariants.mjs`
// says so where it declines to lean on bundle size — and the whole point of a
// property that will matter later is that it must not be silently dropped in
// the meantime. `assertLazyBoundaries()` costs one regex per build and converts
// "esbuild happens to defer" into "this build refuses to ship if it stops".
// What it must NOT be read as is evidence that the CLI is faster because of it.
//
// ── NO SOURCEMAP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Deliberate, not a convenience. A sourcemap embeds `sourcesContent` — the full
// text of every module — which would roughly triple the tarball, and its
// `sources` array is the classic way an absolute build path (a CI runner's
// working directory, a developer's home directory) gets baked into a shipped
// artefact. The CLI is the one artefact users download and unpack. A checkout
// still debugs against the `.ts` sources; a stack trace from the bundle names
// `dist/index.js` and a line, which the per-module path comments below resolve
// to a module by inspection.

// ── WIPE dist/ FIRST, AND WHY IT IS NOT HOUSEKEEPING ────────────────────────
//
// `apps/cli/package.json` ships `"files": ["dist"]`, so `npm pack` takes
// whatever is in this directory — and esbuild writes one file and leaves every
// other one alone. Before this change `dist/` held twelve tsc outputs plus
// their `.d.ts` and `.map` siblings, INCLUDING `args.test.js`, `diff.test.js`
// and `fix.test.js`, so without this line a developer's tarball would carry the
// test suite and a fresh CI checkout's would not: two different artefacts from
// one commit. Those stale bytes would also be read by
// `scripts/sec-a2-egress-scan.mjs`, which scans this directory as the shipped
// CLI, so they would be audited as if they were shipped code — which, in that
// tarball, they were.
//
// Removing the directory makes the output a function of the input. `force` so a
// first build on a fresh clone is not an error.

 * Assert that `action.yml` builds every workspace package this bundle inlined,
 * BEFORE it builds the CLI.
 *
 * ★ WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT WHERE IT USED TO.
 *
 * `scripts/check-packaging-invariants.mjs` invariant 6 owned this property. It
 * derived the CLI's transitive workspace closure from `dependencies` in the
 * package manifests and required each name to appear in action.yml's build
 * block ahead of the CLI's own line — because the Action builds from a clean
 * checkout, so an unbuilt dependency has no `dist` and the CLI build fails in
 * CI only, long after it looked fine locally. That is not hypothetical; the
 * comment there records it happening with `@vibeguard/analysis-graph`.
 *
 * Moving the six `@vibeguard/*` packages to devDependencies (they are inlined,
 * so nothing resolves them at run time) empties the field that invariant read.
 * Its closure becomes `[]`, its loop runs zero times, and it reports OK for any
 * action.yml whatsoever. The property did NOT stop mattering — esbuild resolves
 * `@vibeguard/analyzer-core` to `packages/analyzer-core/dist/index.js`, so the
 * Action still has to build every one of them first — only its enforcement
 * evaporated. Silently gutting a check while claiming the same green line is
 * exactly what this repository refuses everywhere else, so the check moves to
 * the one place that cannot be fooled about what the CLI needs: the build that
 * just consumed it.
 *
 * It is also STRICTLY STRONGER than what it replaces. The old version asked a
 * manifest what the CLI declares; this asks esbuild's metafile what the bundle
 * actually contains. A package pulled in transitively, or by a relative import
 * that no manifest mentions, is invisible to the first and unavoidable to the
 * second.
