// check-packaging-invariants — assert the things that only break at release time.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// `vsce package` refuses to build when `@types/vscode` is newer than
// `engines.vscode`: the extension would be type-checked against APIs a supported
// host does not have. That is a real constraint, and it has now broken TWICE.
//
// It was fixed once, in the commit that cut v0.1.3 ("fix vsce engines/types
// mismatch"), and reintroduced afterwards by an automated dependency bump that
// moved `@types/vscode` forward on its own. Nobody noticed for weeks, because
// packaging only runs from `release.yml`, which only fires on a `v*` tag. The
// window between two releases is exactly the window in which nothing checks it.
//
// A no-egress workflow added later happens to package the real artefacts on every
// push, so it would now catch this as a side effect. That is not a guarantee: it
// is one refactor of an unrelated workflow away from disappearing, and a check
// nobody named is a check nobody will miss. This file names it.
//
// Detection rather than suppression. Telling the dependency bot to ignore
// `@types/vscode` would stop the noise and also stop the signal — raising
// `engines.vscode` deliberately is a legitimate change, and this should permit it
// while refusing the accidental half of it.
//
// Invariants 3–5 answer a different release-time question — "did the cross-file
// analysis package leak into a shipped extension bundle?" — and they exist for
// the same reason invariant 1 does. Until they were written, that boundary was
// the single manually-managed item in the 0.3.0-α plan: someone was expected to
// look at it. Nobody looks at something forever, and the failure is invisible
// (the extension still works, it is just hundreds of KB heavier and now carries
// a project-wide graph builder into a service worker).
//
//   node scripts/check-packaging-invariants.mjs               # everything
//   node scripts/check-packaging-invariants.mjs --pre-build   # source-only subset
//
// Exit 0 if every invariant holds, 1 otherwise, with the failing pair named.
//
// ── WHY THERE ARE TWO MODES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The invariants split cleanly by what they read, and the split is forced by
// where this runs in CI:
//
//   source-only (1, 2, 4)  read package.json files and source imports. They need
//                          no build, which is the whole reason `ci.yml` calls
//                          this BEFORE `npm run build` — a `vsce` engines
//                          mismatch should be reported in seconds with the fix
//                          spelled out, not after a full build.
//   bundle       (3, 5)    read `extensions/*/dist`. They cannot run before the
//                          build, because the artefacts do not exist yet.
//
// Running everything in the pre-build step would make invariant 3 fail on every
// push — dist is legitimately absent there — and the obvious repair (treat a
// missing dist as a skip) is precisely the failure this file exists to prevent:
// a probe that silently passes when it has nothing to inspect is the manual
// review it replaced, wearing a green tick. So the modes are explicit instead.
// `--pre-build` promises less and delivers it; the default promises everything
// and hard-fails when it cannot deliver.
//
// The default is the STRICT one on purpose. A developer running this by hand,
// and the vitest wrapper in `scripts/packaging-invariants.test.ts`, both get the
// full check without having to know a flag exists; only the one caller that
// genuinely cannot satisfy it opts down, and it says so on the command line
// where a reviewer of `ci.yml` can see it.

// transitive re-export, a dynamic import esbuild chose to inline, or a

// string literal survives bundling and minification, so this one is answered by
// reading the artefact.
//
// ★ MEASURED — and re-measured, because the needle changed underneath it.
//
// HISTORY, kept because the reasoning is still the reason this needle is what it
// is. When the needle was the `AG_BUNDLE_SENTINEL` string, the invariant was
// falsified three ways against the real esbuild config and fired in only one:
//
//   `import "@vibeguard/analysis-graph";`           bundle 7.0 KB → 7.0 KB, NO hit
//   `import { createBudget } ...; createBudget({})` bundle 7.0 KB → 9.4 KB, NO hit
//   `import { AG_BUNDLE_SENTINEL } ...; log(it)`    bundle 7.0 KB → 7.2 KB, HIT
//
// The reason was tree shaking: esbuild includes the MODULE and then drops the
// individual declarations nothing references, and a `const` string nobody reads
// is exactly such a declaration. A realistic leak therefore left no sentinel.
//
// THAT IS WHY THE PRIMARY NEEDLE IS NOW `MODULE_MARKER` (below) — the module-path
// comment esbuild emits for every module it includes, which survives exactly when
// the module is included, i.e. the thing we actually want to detect.
//
// RE-MEASURED 2026-07-28 against the current needle, by injecting into the VS
// Code extension entry, rebuilding, running this probe, and reverting:
//
//   `import "@vibeguard/analysis-graph";`                     invariant 3 FAILS
//   `import { createBudget } ...; const b = createBudget();`   invariant 3 FAILS
//   `import { crossFileRules } ...; log(crossFileRules.length)` invariant 3 FAILS
//   (clean tree)                                               all invariants PASS
//
// So with the module-path needle this invariant does catch the ordinary leak, and
// the "fires in only one of three" limit above belongs to the sentinel era. Do not
// weaken this check on the strength of the historical numbers. Invariant 4 still
// catches the same three at the import and the manifest, and remains the cheaper
// and earlier signal — this one additionally covers what 4 is blind to: a
// hand-patched `dist`, a vendored copy, or a build shipping an artefact the
// source tree no longer explains.
//
// `.map` files are excluded on purpose. Source maps embed `sourcesContent` —
// the ORIGINAL text of every module, including modules whose exports were
// tree-shaken away — so a map can legitimately contain the sentinel while the
// shipped `.js` does not. Maps are also not loaded by the browser or by VS Code

// ── Invariant 5: shipped bundles stay near their recorded size ──────────────
//
// A coarse backstop BEHIND invariants 3 and 4, not a size budget. Its job is to
// catch a leak neither of them can see — a vendored copy, a fork of the package
// under another name, an artefact whose source tree no longer explains it — by
// noticing that the shipped bundle suddenly got much bigger.
//
// ★ WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT CATCH TODAY, measured rather than assumed.
//
// The intended argument is "a full `analysis-graph` inclusion is hundreds of KB
// against ~200 KB bundles, so it cannot hide inside a 10% band". That argument
// is about the package this will GROW into, and it is not yet true of the
// package that exists: `analysis-graph` is a 0.3.0-α skeleton, and forcing a
// real consuming import into `background.ts` moved it 7.0 KB → 9.4 KB — well
// inside the band, invisible here. Invariant 4 caught that leak; this one did
// not, and would not have.
//
// So the honest reading is: this is a tripwire that becomes load-bearing as the
// package fills out (structure indexer, dependency graph, symbol table, taint),
// and until then it is a cheap guard against gross regressions. It was verified
// to fire — dropping the vscode baseline to 100 KB produced the expected failure
// at 209,016 bytes — so it is a live check and not decoration.
//
// The 10% headroom is chosen so ordinary work does not trip it: adding rules and
// messages moves these totals by single-digit KB. When legitimate growth does
// exceed it, the fix is to update the constants below IN A COMMIT. That is the
// entire mechanism — it converts silent bundle growth into a reviewed diff with
// a number in it, which is a thing a human can argue with.
//
// Baselines measured on the build at the time this invariant was added
// (esbuild output is LF-normalised regardless of the checkout's line endings,
// so these are stable between the Windows dev machine and Linux CI):
//   extensions/chrome/dist   background.js 7,117 + sidepanel/index.js 201,933
//   extensions/vscode/dist   extension.js  209,016
//
// REBASELINED after the 2026-07-29 audit fixes, which is the mechanism working
// as designed: the vscode bundle crossed the ceiling by 154 bytes and that is
// now a reviewed number rather than silent drift. What grew, and why it is
// bundle weight rather than accident:
//   - `maskSecret` gained two more redaction shapes plus a placeholder
//     allowlist, so a credential that is not written as a long quoted token no
//     longer reaches `snippet`/`evidence` verbatim (both extensions embed
//     analyzer-core, so both pay for it);
//   - `parseSuppressions` gained the per-line scan that stops a pragma quoted
//     inside a string literal from silencing the file;
//   - the VS Code extension gained `comment-syntax.ts`, the per-language table
//     that stops the suppression Quick Fix from writing `//` into JSON.
// Measured on the build immediately after those changes:
//   extensions/chrome/dist   226,200
//   extensions/vscode/dist   230,071
//
// REBASELINED AGAIN for 0.3.0-β, and the cause was checked before the number was
// moved rather than after. `VG-AISC-004` (Mock/Dummy Security Leftover) landed in
// `packages/rules/src/rules/ai-supply-chain.ts`, which BOTH extensions embed:
// that one file went 12,621 → 58,326 bytes (+900 lines). Chrome went 226,200 →
// 255,326 and VS Code 230,071 → 257,428, so both crossed the 10% band — the
// backstop firing on a real change, which is the mechanism working.
//
// ★ THE CHECK THAT MATTERED IS NOT THE SIZE, IT IS WHAT THE SIZE IS MADE OF.
// 0.3.0-β also created two CLI-only packages (`external-adapters`, `mcp-guard`),
// and a leak of either would ALSO have shown up here as growth. Verified before
// rebaselining: `packages/analysis-graph/`, `packages/external-adapters/` and
// `packages/mcp-guard/` each appear ZERO times across every shipped `.js`, and
// invariants 3 and 4 both passed. The growth is one rule's own weight.
// Measured on the build immediately after those changes:
//   extensions/chrome/dist   255,326
//   extensions/vscode/dist   257,428
// REBASELINED 2026-08-23 for the four rules added with the build-divergence
// work, and the attribution was taken before the number moved.
//
// HOW IT WAS MEASURED. `git archive v0.3.4 | tar -x` into a scratch directory
// (NOT a worktree, and with its own `npm ci` — see the warning below), built
// there, and both bundles emitted with `--metafile` so the growth could be
// attributed per input rather than guessed:
//
//   v0.3.4  257,347      (the constant below said 257,428; 81 bytes of
//                         build-environment difference, which is what makes
//                         the two comparable rather than identical)
//   now     293,076      delta +35,729
//
//   +10,213  packages/rules/dist/rules/auth.js        VG-AUTH-009/010/011
//    +8,799  analyzer-core/dist/declared-packages.js  0.3.5 declared-package veto

//    ------
//    35,670  (59 bytes of bundler overhead unaccounted, ±0.2%)
//
// ★ AND THE PART THAT DECIDES WHOSE REBASELINE THIS IS. 0.3.5 and 0.3.6
// together added 21,577 bytes, which left the bundle at 278,924 — UNDER the
// 283,170 ceiling. The four new rules added 14,152, and that is what crossed
// it. This is not an inherited deviation being tidied up; the change that broke
// the gate is the change rebaselining it, which is the only arrangement this
// file's doctrine accepts.
//
// A superseded measurement is recorded here because it was wrong in an
// instructive way: an earlier reading had `main` at 294,164, larger than the
// branch, and concluded the ceiling was already breached upstream. That build
// ran in a git worktree whose `node_modules/@vibeguard/*` were junctions into
// THIS repository, so esbuild resolved the workspace packages to the branch's
// own `dist/` and the "main" bundle contained the branch's rules. The same
// junctions were then followed by `git worktree remove --force` and deleted 293
// tracked files out of the working tree. Do not share `node_modules` into a
// worktree; use `git archive` and a separate `npm ci`, as above.
//
// What was checked, and is the check that actually matters here: every
// CLI-only package — analysis-graph, external-adapters, mcp-guard,
// artifact-integrity, evidence-bundle, evidence-verifier — appears ZERO times
// in every shipped `.js`, and invariants 3 and 4 pass. The growth is rule
// weight, which is the one thing this bundle is supposed to be made of.
//
// Chrome is unchanged at 255,326 and measured 274,193, inside its ceiling.
//
// REBASELINED 2026-08-30, chrome only, for the VG-MEM-006 widening. Attribution
// taken before the number moved, and taken by substitution rather than by
// reading a metafile, because exactly one input changed:
//
//   HEAD's lang-c.ts, everything else this branch  280,357
//   this branch                                    282,711   delta +2,354
//
// The whole +2,354 is `packages/rules/dist/rules/lang-c.js` (22,954 bytes now).
// It is three things, and all three are vocabulary rather than machinery: a
// second tier of secret words with a per-word veto list, a whole-file context
// test that gates the one word (`sk`) whose collision is with kernel and
// control-theory code, and a cast group in the wipe pattern. Both extensions
// embed the rules package, so both pay; VS Code measured 305,317 against a
// 322,383 ceiling and did not move enough to matter.
//
// ★ WHOSE REBASELINE THIS IS. Chrome sat at 280,357 before this change, 501
// bytes under the ceiling — so the branch is crossing a line the tree had
// already walked up to. That is still this change's line to cross: the doctrine
// above is that the change which breaks the gate is the change which rebaselines
// it, and 2,354 bytes is not a rounding error being blamed on drift.
//
// What was checked before the number moved: analysis-graph, external-adapters,
// mcp-guard, artifact-integrity, evidence-bundle and evidence-verifier each
// appear ZERO times across every shipped `.js` in both extensions, and
// invariants 3 and 4 pass. The growth is rule weight.

// ── Invariant 6: action.yml builds everything the CLI needs ────────────────
//
// `action.yml` does not call the root `build` script. It lists the workspaces to
// build one by one, deliberately, so the Action does not pay for the two
// extension bundles it never uses. That is a reasonable optimisation and it is
// also a SECOND COPY of the dependency order — the kind of duplication that only
// announces itself at the worst moment.
//
// It announced itself once already. `@vibeguard/analysis-graph` was added to the
// CLI's dependencies and to the root build chain, and not to this list. Nothing
// locally noticed, because the root build had already produced the `dist` that
// every local command then read. The Action, which starts from a clean checkout,
// compiled the CLI against a package that had never been built and failed with
// `Cannot find module '@vibeguard/analysis-graph' or its corresponding type
// declarations` — followed by a trail of `implicitly has an 'any' type` errors
// that made the real cause harder to see rather than easier.
//
// So this asserts the two lists agree: every workspace package the CLI depends
// on, transitively, must appear in action.yml's build block BEFORE the CLI
// itself. Order is checked as well as membership, because the CLI's build reads
// the dependency's built output — a name in the right list at the wrong
// position fails in exactly the same way as a name that is missing.
//
// ── WHY BOTH DEPENDENCY FIELDS ARE WALKED ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The CLI now ships as an esbuild bundle, so its `@vibeguard/*` packages moved
// from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`: they are build inputs that get
// inlined, not runtime resolutions the consumer installs. Walking only
// `dependencies`, as this did, made `needed` EMPTY the moment that move landed
// — and an empty `needed` makes the loop below run zero times, so this
// invariant returned green for every possible action.yml. A guard that cannot
// fail is not a guard.
//
// The move did not weaken what has to be true: esbuild resolves
// `@vibeguard/analyzer-core` through that package's `exports` to its `dist`,
// so an unbuilt dependency still breaks the Action from a clean checkout,
// which is the failure this invariant exists to catch. Both fields are walked
// because either one can carry the edge, and the `@vibeguard/` prefix test in
// `visit` keeps third-party devDependencies (typescript, vitest, esbuild) out.

  // at all, so every possible action.yml passed. The vacuous pass is worse than
  // the failure it replaced, because nothing announced it.
  //

// A native toolchain workspace at the repo root. Three things make it different
// from every other directory here, and each one is a way to break the four
// shipped channels without touching them:
//
//   1. It is OUTSIDE the workspace globs (`packages/*`, `apps/*`, `extensions/*`),
//      so `npm ci` and `npm run build` do not walk it. That is what keeps a
//      clang/LLVM dependency out of the release path — and it holds only as long
//      as nobody adds `compiler` to the globs, which is a one-word edit.
//   2. It compiles. Object files, shared libraries and linked binaries are large,
//      machine-specific, and permanent once pushed: history is not rewritten here,
//      because a force-push breaks every consumer of the four channels.
//   3. It is the first place in this repo where C and C++ live. The scanners,
//      censuses and gates that walk the whole tree meet those files for the first
//      time when this directory appears.
//
// Everything below is source-only, so it runs in the `--pre-build` subset and
// costs a CI step nothing. Written BEFORE the directory exists on purpose: a
// boundary guard added after the boundary is crossed has already missed the
// crossing it was for. Until then the first three checks still bind (they are
// about the light side, which exists today) and the rest report as inapplicable.

// is legitimate — a test fixture is supposed to contain the pattern it tests,
// and a rule's own source contains the strings it matches — and every one names
// the rule IDs rather than wildcarding. That is exactly why the count needs a
// guard: the mechanism is normal enough here that adding one more never looks
// like an event, and a pragma added to silence a REAL finding is
// indistinguishable in a diff from a pragma added for a fixture.
//
// Same mechanism as the bundle-size ceiling above, and the same instruction:
// when the growth is legitimate, update the constant IN A COMMIT, so the new
// number is something a reviewer saw rather than something that happened. This
// is a source-only check, so it runs in the `--pre-build` subset too.
{
  // 2026-08-03: 53 → 56. Three file-scope exemptions were added in the 0.3.0-β

  // executable code, and each naming its rule id rather than blanket-suppressing:
  //   · packages/external-adapters/src/weakness-class.ts       VG-INJ-004
  //     The eval-exec family table holds `eval-detected` / `eval-injection` /
  //     `user-eval` check-id patterns and prose about CWE-95. It is a copy of the
  //     table in scripts/sec-transfer-semgrep.mjs, which already carries exactly
  //     this exemption for exactly this reason. Without it the main-push gate
  //     (`--fail-on critical`) goes red on 2 findings — measured, not predicted.
  //   · packages/analysis-graph/src/design-smells-crossfile/temporal-security-coupling.ts  VG-INJ-006
  //     The doc comment quotes `el.innerHTML = escapeHtml(name)` to explain why
  //     the sink span stops at the first `(`. Quoting a CORRECTLY sanitised
  //     assignment in order to explain a false positive is not an unsafe write.
  //   · packages/mcp-guard/README.md                            VG-SEC-001
  //     The smoke check hands the guard an AWS-shaped key so the refusal it

  // The count is 53 + 3. Raising it is the designed workflow — this invariant
  // exists so the raise appears in a diff a human reads.
  // 2026-08-04: 56 → 59 (#46 CODESCAN). Three more file-scope exemptions, all
  // three the same shape as the ones above — a rule firing on PROSE THAT QUOTES
  // THE PATTERN THE RULE DETECTS — and each naming one rule id:
  //   · packages/analysis-graph/src/design-smells-crossfile/generated-boilerplate-unintegrated.ts  VG-AUTH-002
  //   · packages/analysis-graph/src/design-smells-crossfile/refused-security-inheritance.ts        VG-AUTH-002
  //     Both doc comments quote an unfinished-authorization marker as the
  //     EXAMPLE of the shape being detected, and VG-AUTH-002 reads the quotation
  //     as a real unimplemented check. (Described rather than quoted here on
  //     purpose: writing the marker itself made THIS file the 60th pragma
  //     candidate, which is the same trap MEASURED LIMIT 8e records for the A1
  //     census. The comment was reworded rather than the baseline raised.)

  //     The doc comment quotes `require('bodyparser')`, a typosquat of
  //     body-parser, to explain what the lockfile veto is for.
  // These were the last three open code-scanning alerts attributed to product
  // code after the test-suite noise moved to .vibeguardrc.json; the remaining
  // 32 were suppressed by path there rather than by pragma, so this count grew
  // by three rather than by eighteen. Measured before and after: the
  // CI-equivalent self-scan goes 39 findings → 0.
  // 2026-08-10: 59 → 58. Not a removal — a miscount. The census read AGENTS.md
  // as a 59th carrier because §8 of that guide shows the directive inside a
  // ```js fence as the EXAMPLE of how to write one. That is documentation, and
  // counting it left the ceiling one above the tree: a real new suppression
  // could land and still pass. Fenced blocks in Markdown are now stripped
  // before the test (see walkPragma), which drops AGENTS.md and keeps the two
  // Markdown files that carry a real one on line 1, outside any fence —
  // CHANGELOG.md and packages/mcp-guard/README.md.
  // 2026-08-24: 58 → 61. Three test files, all three carrying a fixture the

  //   · extensions/vscode/src/claim-surfaces.test.ts       VG-INJ-001
  //     Both carry a SQL-concatenation snippet (the chrome one an innerHTML
  //     write as well) as the `snippet` of a synthetic ORDINARY finding. The
  //     claim ledger is only interesting against a finding that declares no
  //     protection, so the control has to look like a real vulnerability.
  //   · packages/mcp-guard/src/guard.test.ts               VG-SEC-003
