// vibeguard:disable-file VG-INJ-004 reason="eval-exec family mapping strings (eval-detected/eval-injection/user-eval check-id patterns and prose describing CWE-95) — not an executable eval() of untrusted input; same self-scan exemption as packages/rules/src/rules/injection.ts and scripts/e4-prdiff-eval.mjs"
// Cross-tool evasion transfer, arm 2 of 3: Semgrep (a MULTI-LANGUAGE pattern
// engine) as a second external point on the tool axis, beside Bandit.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (read together with sec-transfer-bandit.mjs)
// The Bandit arm answers the transfer question for ONE language (Python) with
// ONE analysis style (a pure-Python AST). That is a down-payment, not a proof:
// a reviewer can still say "regex evasion is a VibeGuard quirk, and Bandit is
// just another Python tool." Semgrep closes both gaps at once:
//   * TOOL axis — Semgrep is a genuinely different engine from both VibeGuard
//     (regex-over-text) and Bandit (per-node Python AST plugins): it compiles
//     each rule to a syntactic PATTERN matched over a real parse tree, a
//     regex/AST hybrid, and ships rules for many languages from one binary.
//   * LANGUAGE axis — the B1 corpus is 6 languages (js 167, python 201, php 22,
//     ruby 13, c# 8, go 5). Bandit could only ever see the 201 Python pairs.
//     Semgrep can see the same weakness expressed in Python, JavaScript and Ruby,
//     so "the transform hides the bug" can be shown to be a property of the
//     TRANSFORM, not of one language's tooling.
//
//   H  (the claim under test, unchanged from the Bandit arm): a
//      semantics-preserving transform that evades VibeGuard's lexical matcher
//      also degrades an independent, non-lexical tool — evasion is a design-level
//      phenomenon, not a VibeGuard implementation bug. Measured as
//      ER(t, semgrep) being non-trivial and comparable to ER(t, vibeguard) on the
//      SAME pairs.
//   ~H (the refutation, stated in advance): Semgrep is essentially unaffected
//      (ER(semgrep) ≈ 0 where VibeGuard is evaded). If that is the result, it is
//      reported as the result — the verdict is computed mechanically from the
//      numbers, never narrated.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT COMPARED — identical discipline to the Bandit arm.
// Only weaknesses BOTH tools ship a detector for are scored, declared up front in
// RULE_FAMILIES. Everything else is reported as out-of-scope and never scored.
// The one new wrinkle is that scope is TWO-DIMENSIONAL here: a family can be in
// scope for Python (Semgrep p/default has a rule) yet out of scope for C#/PHP
// (it does not fire there). `languages` on each family records exactly which
// language×family cells Semgrep actually covers, and a pair outside them is
// out-of-scope with its (family, language) reason — never a silent zero.
//
// THE MAPPING IS EMPIRICAL, NOT INVENTED.
// Semgrep check_ids are not stable short codes like Bandit's `B307`; they are
// long dotted paths (`python.lang.security.audit.eval-detected.eval-detected`)
// and, when a vendored rules file is used, they carry the vendor path as a
// prefix. So a family maps to a set of REGEXES over the check_id, and every
// pattern here was confirmed to match a check_id that Semgrep actually emitted on
// a known-vulnerable ORIGINAL in this corpus (see scripts/README or the
// derivation note). A pattern that matches nothing is a dead mapping and is
// caught by assertion A6.
//
// DETECTION SEMANTICS — identical to the Bandit arm, kept symmetric between tools:
//   * fileLevel   — the tool flags the mapped weakness ANYWHERE in the file
//                   (headline; no line tolerance, symmetric by construction).
//   * lineAnchored — the flag lands within LINE_TOLERANCE of the expected payload
//                   line (robustness check; 'relocated' findings excluded and
//                   bounded).
//
// Negative controls NC1 (fix-real) and NC2 (noop-reformat) are excluded from every
// pooled figure and reported on their own; a non-zero ER on NC2 means the harness
// is manufacturing evasions and the run must not be believed (assertion A1).
//
// DETERMINISM & REPRODUCIBILITY. No clock, no randomness; every listing/map/array
// is sorted, output is deep key-sorted JSON. Two runs on the same tree with the
// same ruleset produce byte-identical JSON. The ruleset is a LOCAL VENDORED file
// (a snapshot of `p/default`), NOT pulled from the live registry — the live
// registry changes over time and needs the network. That snapshot lives under
// `security-experiment/` and, like the rest of that tree (the corpus, the
// manifest, the result JSONs), is .gitignore'd rather than committed, so it is
// NOT in version control: a fresh checkout must re-fetch it (the script prints the
// command). Because a re-fetch of `p/default` drifts over time, the exact ruleset
// the published numbers were produced with is PINNED here by EXPECTED_RULES_SHA256:
// if the vendored file's hash does not match, the run is BLOCKED (not silently
// re-scored against a different ruleset). Pass --allow-rules-drift to score against
// a different snapshot on purpose; the output then records driftFromExpected=true.
//
// A missing or unusable Semgrep is a BLOCKED RUN, not a zero: the script fails
// loudly rather than emitting fabricated all-absent numbers (which would read as
// "Semgrep evades everything").

/**
 * THE MAPPING TABLE — the load-bearing declaration of this script.
 *
 * Each entry names one weakness class, the VibeGuard rules that detect it, the
 * Semgrep check_id REGEXES that detect it, and the languages Semgrep actually
 * fires on for it. A pair is IN the compared subset iff its ruleId appears here
 * AND its language is in that family's `languages`. Everything else is
 * out-of-scope and reported as such.
 *
 * The VG-rule → weakness assignment is deliberately IDENTICAL to
 * sec-transfer-bandit.mjs where the families overlap, so the two external arms
 * are scored against the same VibeGuard side and can be quoted side by side.
 * Two families are Semgrep-only (cookie flags, insecure transport) because they
 * are JavaScript weaknesses Bandit cannot see at all — they are what the language
 * axis buys.
 *
 * Every `semgrepPatterns` regex was confirmed against a check_id Semgrep emitted
 * on a real vulnerable ORIGINAL in THIS corpus. Patterns match the check_id tail,
 * so they survive the vendor-path prefix a vendored config prepends.
 *
 * This table is embedded verbatim in the output JSON so scoring can be re-derived
 * from the artifact alone.
