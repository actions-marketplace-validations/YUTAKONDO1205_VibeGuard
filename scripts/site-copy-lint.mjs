// site-copy-lint — refuse to publish a promise the repository cannot keep.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Release 0.3.5 was cut with this commit message:
//
//   `Release 0.3.5: ship the two C/C++ rules, and stop the README promising
//    them early`
//
// The author had already written, in the README, that something existed before
// it did — and then had to go back and unwrite it. That is the exact accident
// this file is aimed at, moved one surface over. A README lives in a repository
// that a reader arrives at with context; a website is indexed, quoted, shared,
// and screenshotted, and the wrong sentence on it outlives the commit that
// fixed it.
//
// The design document's chapter 0 puts five defences against that accident on
// five different layers. Two of them are structural and the other three are
// conventions people have to remember. This file is the second structural one:
// `ResearchLayout.astro` makes the promise impossible to *compose* (there is no
// CTA component in its import graph), and this makes it impossible to *write*
// (the words do not survive CI). Everything else is a guideline, and guidelines
// are what produced 0.3.5.
//
//   node scripts/site-copy-lint.mjs            # source mode: site/src, site/public
//   node scripts/site-copy-lint.mjs --dist     # artefact mode: site/dist
//   node scripts/site-copy-lint.mjs --site DIR # point either mode at another tree
//
// Exit 0 when every rule holds, 1 otherwise, with the file, line and reason
// named.
//
// ── WHY THERE ARE TWO MODES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// They ask different questions and neither subsumes the other.
//
//   SOURCE   reads what a person typed. It runs before anything is built, so a
//            banned word is reported in seconds by the same `npm test` a
//            developer already runs, and it can see things the artefact cannot:
//            colour literals in the CSS a bundler will later concatenate, and
//            the constant tables in `site/src/shared/links.ts` / `headers.ts`.
//   ARTEFACT reads what will actually be served. Source mode cannot answer
//            "did a <script> tag reach the HTML?" or "does _headers exist?",
//            because both are produced by the build. A CSP that says
//            `script-src 'none'` is a declaration until something checks that
//            the pages contain no script; then it is a measured property.
//
// Running only one of them would leave a whole half unchecked, so `site/`'s
// build pipeline runs source mode before `astro build` and artefact mode after.
//
// ── ZERO DEPENDENCIES, ON PURPOSE ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Same reasoning as `scripts/check-packaging-invariants.mjs`, which this file
// is modelled on: a guard that needs an install step is a guard that stops
// running in exactly the broken checkout where you most want it. Everything
// here is `node:fs` plus regular expressions over text, with one optional
// dynamic import (the built rules package) that has a source-text fallback.
//
// ── AND A VACUITY GUARD, FOR THE SAME REASON THAT FILE HAS ONE ──────────────
//
// The single most likely way for this linter to stop working is not a bug in a
// regex. It is a rename — `src/pages` moves, the glob stops matching, the walk
// returns zero files, and every rule below passes over nothing. That failure is
// invisible: the CI line stays green and says "OK". So the number of content
// pages actually read is compared against a floor, and a scan that fell below
// it is a FAILURE and not a warning. Chapter 2 of the design document freezes
// the site at six content URLs; if that number is ever deliberately reduced,
// the constant moves in the same commit, which is a diff a reviewer can argue
// with.

 *   · `class=` and `style=` attribute values, for the same reason — a class
