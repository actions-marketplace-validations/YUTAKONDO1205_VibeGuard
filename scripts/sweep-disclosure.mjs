// sweep-disclosure — the single supported way to run a disclosure sweep, and a
// sweep that proves its own instrument before it says anything about the tree.
//
// WHY THIS WRAPPER EXISTS WHEN THE DETECTOR ALREADY DID
//
// scripts/check-disclosure-shape.mjs holds the needles and is good at what it
// does. It is not the thing that broke. What broke, twice, was the PLUMBING
// around it, and both times the symptom was identical and reassuring:
//
//   * a path-conversion layer between two operating systems swallowed a pattern
//     that began with a slash, so the pattern was never handed to the matcher;
//   * a here-doc ate one level of backslash, so the needle that reached the
//     matcher was not the needle that had been written.
//
// In both cases the run completed, printed a small confident number, and the
// number was zero. Nobody re-ran anything, because there was nothing to re-run:
// a clean sweep is what you hope for and it arrived. The detector's own
// `--self-test` could not have caught either one — it fires the needles against
// in-memory strings inside a single process, which is upstream of every layer
// that was actually broken.
//
// So this program does the only thing that closes that hole. Before it reports
// anything at all, it WRITES known-positive files to disk, hands their paths to
// the detector as a real child process, reads the detector's real stdout, and
// checks that every planted needle came back — byte for byte, not merely "some
// hit was reported". If one did not, the run stops with a non-zero code and
// prints NOTHING about the real tree. A broken instrument must not produce a
// reading, and "0 hits" from a broken instrument is the most dangerous reading
// there is.
//
// The second half is the other failure this repository actually had: a whole
// audit conducted against a remote-tracking ref that was sixty-odd commits old.
// That is delegated to scripts/ref-freshness.mjs, which is runnable on its own,
// and gated here.
//
// USAGE
//
//   node scripts/sweep-disclosure.mjs                 # sweep the tracked tree
//   node scripts/sweep-disclosure.mjs --dir <path>    # sweep a directory instead
//   node scripts/sweep-disclosure.mjs --allow-empty   # 0 inputs is not an error
//   node scripts/sweep-disclosure.mjs --verbose
//   node scripts/sweep-disclosure.mjs --detector <p>  # substitute the detector
//   node scripts/sweep-disclosure.mjs --plant-dir <p> # where the positives go
//   node scripts/sweep-disclosure.mjs --ls-remote-from <f>   # see ref-freshness
//
// EXIT CODES (interfaces.md section 7)
//
//   0  swept, instrument verified, nothing found  → `VERDICT: CLEAN`
//   1  the tool failed (no git, the detector could not be spawned)
//   2  disclosure-shaped strings found            → `VERDICT: FINDINGS`
//   3  no answer available: a planted positive was not detected, the negative
//      control fired, nothing was scanned, or the target ref is stale
//
// The string `VERDICT` is emitted on exactly one line and only when the run is
// entitled to one. Every failure path above is silent about the tree on purpose,
// so `grep VERDICT` is a sound test of whether an answer was given.
//
// ON THE LITERALS
//
// Every needle below is assembled from fragments or code points at runtime, and
// none of them appears whole in this file. That is not style. This file is
// tracked, so the sweep it runs scans it; written literally, the planted
// positives would be found in the planter and a clean repository would fail.
// The same constraint governs scripts/check-disclosure-shape.mjs:40. Do not
// "tidy" these into literal strings.
