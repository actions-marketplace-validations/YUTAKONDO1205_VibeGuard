// vibeguard:disable-file VG-INJ-006
// The GAP descriptions below quote attack shapes as prose — the `risk:` field
// spells out `el.innerHTML = '<img src=' + host + '>'` to name exactly what the
// AST leg does and does not catch. VibeGuard's DOM-XSS rule matches that literal
// string; the self-scan gate would fail on the scanner's own documentation of
// what it scans for. Same treatment as scripts/sec-a1-shape-check.mjs and the
// rule sources that disable the rules whose fixtures they carry. This is a Node
// script with no DOM, so a real innerHTML sink can never appear here.
//
// A2 — no-egress assertion over the execution closure of the shipped code.
//
// SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM. Not "four distribution channels" — that phrasing counts
// marketing surfaces and quietly implies the GitHub Action is audited the same
// way the others are, which it is not (A2-GAP-4). What this file asserts over is
// the EXECUTION CLOSURE of the artefacts we scan: every JS/TS file a user can
// end up running from a VibeGuard install, plus the HTML and CSS the Chrome
// side panel loads (those egress without any JavaScript at all — see the
// markup section below).
//
// ★ THE CLI'S CLOSURE CHANGED SHAPE IN 0.3.5, AND SO DID THE ARGUMENT FOR
// SCANNING packages/*/dist. It used to be that `apps/cli/dist/index.js` was tsc
// output whose very first import reached into @vibeguard/analyzer-core, which
// pulled in the other workspace packages: scanning only apps/cli/dist audited a
// handful of thin re-export files and left the analyzer itself outside the
// assertion. That is why `targets()` enumerates packages/*/dist at all.
//
// `apps/cli` is now bundled by `apps/cli/build.mjs` (esbuild, one file, no
// runtime dependencies — the tsc build produced a tarball that could not be
// installed, because the six `@vibeguard/*` names it declared exist on no
// registry). The CLI's execution closure is therefore ONE FILE, and that file
// contains the analyzer inline, so scanning `apps/cli/dist` now genuinely does
// scan the analyzer. The packages/*/dist targets remain, and remain required,
// for two reasons that did not go away:
//   - the two extensions bundle the same packages, and those bundles are built
//     by different esbuild invocations with different conditions/entry points,
//     so `packages/analyzer-core/dist` is what the vscode and chrome artefacts
//     are made from as much as the CLI is;
//   - a package's own dist is the only place a sink can be seen BEFORE a
//     bundler has had a chance to tree-shake it out of one artefact while
//     leaving it in another.
// The closure-completeness check below keeps that enumeration self-policing
// rather than a list somebody has to remember to extend.
//
// WHAT THIS DEFENDS. PRIVACY.md claims「コードは端末外に出ない」and SCOPE.md §3
// A2 makes that claim part of the availability/confidentiality contribution
// (C4: the detector's own attack surface). A claim nobody can falsify is not a
// security property, it is marketing. This script turns it into a CI assertion:
// build the distributables, parse them, count network sinks, require zero.
//
// WHY NOT grep. The obvious implementation — `grep -R "fetch(" dist/` — is
// actively wrong here and would have to be neutered into uselessness. The
// analyzer ships rule definitions whose whole job is to RECOGNISE `fetch`,
// `http`, `eval`; those rule patterns are string literals inside the bundle, so
// a textual grep over dist/ lights up on VibeGuard's own detection logic. The
// only way to distinguish "the bundle mentions fetch" from "the bundle CALLS
// fetch" is to look at the syntax tree. So the unit of detection here is a
// CallExpression / NewExpression / import specifier — never a substring.
//
// PARSER CHOICE. `typescript` (TypeScript 5.x, `ts.createSourceFile`). It is a
// declared root devDependency, so this script adds no dependency at all, and it
// is not a runtime dependency of anything we ship. acorn is present in
// node_modules too but only transitively (acorn-walk ← mlly ← vitest), and
// depending on a transitive package is how a "verified" check quietly breaks on
// the next lockfile refresh.
//
// VACUOUS-PASS DEFENCE. A scanner that looks at nothing reports zero sinks and
// exits green. There are four distinct ways to look at nothing, and each needs
// its own guard:
//   1. Scanning a target too thinly. Every target declares a minimum file
//      count; scanning fewer files fails.
//   2. A broken detector. `--mode control` feeds seeded-violation fixtures
//      (scripts/fixtures/a2-egress/) through the SAME detector and requires
//      each one to be caught. If the detector is blinded, the control goes red.
//   3. Scanning stale bytes. CI builds and packages in the same job, so a
//      committed dist from three commits ago cannot be what got scanned.
//   4. NOT SCANNING A DIRECTORY AT ALL. This is the one the first three are
//      blind to, and it is the failure this file actually shipped with: an
//      `await fetch(...)` appended to packages/analyzer-core/dist/index.js used
//      to leave `--mode dist` green, because `targets()` listed only apps/cli/
//      dist, extensions/vscode/dist and extensions/chrome/dist. minFiles is
//      satisfied by the files we DID scan; the control fixtures pass because
//      the detector was never broken; freshness is irrelevant to bytes nobody
//      opened. A file-count floor cannot floor a directory that is not in the
//      list. The guard for (4) is therefore structural rather than numeric:
//      `checkClosureCompleteness()` requires every package that `--mode deps`
//      waved through on the strength of its NAME to also be a directory this
//      script opened and parsed. Adding a sixth @vibeguard/* package fails CI
//      until it is scanned. Nothing here defends against a distributable whose
//      execution closure escapes the workspace entirely — that is what the
//      production dependency allowlist is for.
//
// MODES
//   --mode dist     (default) AST-scan the execution closure + manifest lock
//   --mode control  negative control: seeded fixtures MUST be detected
//   --mode deps     production dependency allowlist + closure completeness
//   --mode compare  --a x.json --b y.json: findings equal modulo findingId
//   --mode all      dist + control + deps
//
// FLAGS
//   --cli-dir <dir>     scan an unpacked `npm pack` tarball instead of apps/cli/dist
//   --vscode-dir <dir>  scan an extracted .vsix instead of extensions/vscode/dist
//   --chrome-dir <dir>  scan an unzipped Chrome bundle instead of extensions/chrome/dist
//   --out <path>        write the JSON report (default under _results/)
//   --quiet             suppress the per-target console table
//
// CI points the three --*-dir flags at the artifacts release.yml actually
// publishes (unpacked tarball / unzipped .vsix / unzipped Chrome bundle), so
// what gets audited is the shipped bytes rather than a build tree that happens
// to sit next to them. Locally the defaults keep it a one-command check.

//
// WHY THESE FILES AT ALL. extensions/chrome/dist ships sidepanel/index.html and
// sidepanel/index.css, and manifest.json points side_panel.default_path at the
// HTML. A single `<img src="https://…/p.gif?d=CODE">` in that file exfiltrates
// with no JavaScript anywhere in the closure, and the AST scan above would keep
// reporting a clean zero — the zero of not having looked. That was A2-GAP-3.
//
// WHY REGEX HERE WHEN grep WAS REJECTED FOR JS. The argument against grepping
// JS was not "regexes are crude", it was that the discriminator was unavailable
// to a regex: the bundle legitimately CONTAINS the string `fetch(` inside rule
// definitions, and only the syntax tree separates "mentions" from "calls".
// Markup does not have that problem, because the discriminator here is the URL
// SCHEME rather than an identifier name. A rule pattern, a placeholder, or a
// paragraph of prose may say `src` or `url(` as often as it likes; what gets
// flagged is a value that resolves off-machine, and no VibeGuard rule payload
// carries one of those. The residual risk of a regex over markup is the mirror
// image of grep-over-JS: over-matching (a `<img src=https://…>` written inside
// an HTML comment or a text node) rather than under-matching. Over-matching
// costs a human one look; under-matching is the silent green this whole file
// exists to prevent, so the trade is taken deliberately in that direction. The
// one place markup carries real code — inline <script> and on* handlers — is
// NOT regexed for sinks: its contents are handed to scanSource() and get the
// same AST treatment as any shipped .js.
//

 *
 * `minBytes` is the same guard expressed in the unit that survives BUNDLING.
 * See the `cli` target below for why a file count stopped being able to express
 * it there.
 *
 * `packageName` is what makes this list self-policing. Any target that IS a
 * published workspace package carries its npm name here, and
 * checkClosureCompleteness() cross-references those names against the
 * production dependency closure. A package that `--mode deps` accepted purely
 * because its name matched `@vibeguard/` but that appears in no target is a
 * hard failure — that combination is precisely "trusted without being read".
 *
 * The three shipped-artefact targets accept a --*-dir override so CI can point
 * them at the unpacked tarball / .vsix / zip. The workspace package targets do
 * NOT: they are not themselves published or packaged in any form — the CLI
 * INLINES them (esbuild, `apps/cli/build.mjs`) and each extension bundle
 * inlines its own copy — so there is no separate packaged artefact to point at
 * and the build tree is the only place their un-bundled bytes exist. That means
 * for the packages the scanned bytes are the ones CI just built rather than the
 * ones a consumer receives; what a consumer receives is the bundle, which IS
 * scanned, under the `cli`/`vscode`/`chrome` targets. Both halves come from the
 * same tsc invocation on the same commit in the same job.
 *
 * ★ CORRECTING A CLAIM THIS COMMENT USED TO MAKE. It said the workspace
 * packages were unpackaged because "the CLI tarball does not vendor them; `npm
 * i` resolves them from the registry". That was false in both directions and it
 * mattered: the six `@vibeguard/*` names have never been published — publishing
 * is permanently abandoned, and `check-packaging-invariants.mjs` invariant 2
 * asserts `private: true` to keep it that way — so `npm i` resolved nothing and
 * the release tarball could not be installed at all. It is now false the other
 * way: the tarball DOES vendor them, inlined into `dist/index.js`, and nothing
 * is resolved from a registry at install time. The sentence is replaced rather
 * than patched because the reasoning it supported ("their bytes are never
 * repackaged") reached the right target list for the wrong reason.

    // files. `apps/cli` is now a single esbuild bundle, so a fresh
    // `npm run build` leaves EXACTLY ONE scannable file in `apps/cli/dist` and
    // the old floor would fail every run. The wrong repair — and the one this
    // comment exists to forbid — is to drop the number to 1 and move on: that
    // silently retires the guard, because a floor of 1 is satisfied by a
    // directory containing a single empty file, or by the wrong directory that
    // happens to have any `.js` in it.
    //
    // What the floor was for was never the count; it was "prove you looked at
    // something substantial". Under a bundle that quantity is BYTES. A complete
    // bundle is ~680 KB (682,746 measured 2026-08-16) because it carries the
    // entire rule set — the figure drifts with ordinary source edits;
    // anything that resolved `@vibeguard/*` to a stub, pointed at a stale or
    // half-written directory, or marked the workspace packages external comes
    // out an order of magnitude smaller. So `minFiles` drops to 1 — the count
    // genuinely carries no information now — and `minBytes` takes over the job
    // it was doing, at a level (400 KB) no stub can reach and ordinary rule
    // growth cannot fall below. `apps/cli/build.mjs` asserts the SAME floor on
    // the build side, independently, so the two have to fail together.

// PROD_DEP_ALLOWLIST accepts a dependency on the strength of its NAME. That is
// a reasonable rule — we do control everything under @vibeguard/ — but taken
// alone it is a trust assertion, not a verification: `npm ls` reports names,
// and a name says nothing about whether the package calls fetch(). Between the
// name-based allowlist and the AST scan there was a gap wide enough to drive
// the entire analyzer through, and it was open: appending an outbound fetch to
// packages/analyzer-core/dist/index.js left `--mode dist` reporting PASS,
// because @vibeguard/analyzer-core was allowlisted by name and scanned by
// nobody.
//
// The fix is to refuse to let those two facts be established independently.
// Every package the allowlist waves through must ALSO be a directory some
// target opened and parsed, and this check fails if it is not. The property it
// buys is the one that survives future contributors: when a sixth workspace
// package is added, `npm ls` reports it, the name matches `@vibeguard/`, the
// allowlist accepts it — and CI goes red until it is added to targets(). The
// only way to obtain a green run is to have actually read the code.
//
// The check is deliberately one-directional. A target with no packageName
// (vscode, chrome) is fine — those are shipped artefacts, not dependencies.
// What is not fine is a dependency with no target.
//
// ★ HOW FAR THIS REACHES AFTER 0.3.5, STATED PLAINLY BECAUSE IT SHRANK.
//
// Bundling the CLI emptied its production dependency closure: `npm ls
// --omit=dev --workspace @vibeguard/cli` now reports the workspace node and
// nothing under it, because the six `@vibeguard/*` packages moved to
// devDependencies (they are inlined at build time, so nothing resolves them at
// run time). This check therefore now examines exactly one name,
// `@vibeguard/cli`, and demands that the `cli` target scanned it and passed.
//
// That is a smaller claim than it made in 0.3.4, and pretending otherwise would
// be the kind of quiet over-statement this file exists to refuse. What replaced
// the reach is not nothing, and it is worth naming precisely:
//   - the CLI's execution closure is now ONE FILE, and that file is scanned in
//     full, so there is no longer a gap between "trusted by name" and "read" for
//     the CLI — there are no names left to trust;
//   - `apps/cli/build.mjs` asserts at BUILD time that specific packages
//     (analyzer-core, rules, findings-schema, remediation-engine, plus the three
//     lazily-imported ones) are actually inside that file, so "the bundle
//     silently lost the analyzer" fails there rather than passing here;
//   - a future third-party runtime dependency is still caught by
//     PROD_DEP_ALLOWLIST, and a future `@vibeguard/*` runtime dependency (one
//     deliberately left external) still lands here and still demands a target.
// The teeth are intact for what remains; the surface they bite is smaller
// because the surface itself got smaller.
