// H2 — the self-hardening CI gate.
//
// Ordinary SAST regression-tests OTHER people's code. This script regression-
// tests VibeGuard's OWN attack surface on every build: the ReDoS surface of its
// rule regexes (A1), the evasion rate of rewrites against the shipped detector
// (B1), the concealment rate of triage-abuse disguises (B3), and the sample
// corpora whose finding SETS the whole product is calibrated against. §9.4 calls
// this the recursive structure — 「検出器が毎ビルド自分の攻撃面を回帰テストする」 —
// and the only way it is worth anything is if a regression FAILS THE BUILD rather
// than being written to a report nobody opens.
//
// ⚠ RUN ONE AT A TIME. This script REGENERATES its corpora into
// `security-experiment/_results/` on every run, so two concurrent invocations
// overwrite each other's inputs mid-flight and the B1 arm reports failures that
// have nothing to do with the tree. Measured 2026-08-03: a background
// `npm test && sec-selftest` overlapping a foreground `sec-selftest` produced
// `5 failed — b1:corpus-scale, b1:delta-er-floor, b1:er-false-ceiling,
// b1:er-true-ceiling, b1:harness-integrity`, while `--arms b1` alone and a clean
// solo run both gave 5/5 and 21/22 · 0 failed. CI is safe (one job, one run), but
// a human or an agent running this in two terminals gets a red self-hardening
// gate for no reason — and a gate that cries wolf is a gate people stop reading.
//
// Run from the repo root, after `npm run build`:
//   node scripts/sec-selftest.mjs
//   node scripts/sec-selftest.mjs --arms corpus,a1        (subset; marks the run
//                                                          non-authoritative)
//   node scripts/sec-selftest.mjs --baseline <path> --manifest-out <path>
//
// Exit 0 only when every gate the baseline declares for the arms that ran came
// back `pass`, or came back `unmeasured` on a gate the baseline pre-declares as
// optional. Anything else is a non-zero exit.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ Why the corpora are REGENERATED here instead of being committed
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The obvious design is "commit the B1/B3 corpora, scan them in CI". It cannot
// work, and the reason is not laziness — it is deliberate.
//
// The directory the generators write into is excluded by .gitignore and carries
// no tracked files, so on a CI runner the corpora DO NOT EXIST. `git add -f`
// would defeat the exclusion the entry exists to enforce, so it is not an
// option either.
//
//   ⚠ Do not restore the worked example that used to sit here. It quoted a
//     `git check-ignore -v` transcript, which meant this file carried both a
//     line number into .gitignore — already stale by sixteen lines when it was
//     found — and a sentence saying what the withheld directory CONTAINS. The
//     second is the disclosure the ignore-file rule exists to prevent: the
//     path's name is unavoidable, an annotation explaining why it is worth
//     having is not. State the mechanism, never the contents.
//
// The generators' INPUTS, however, are tracked and small:
//   samples/vulnerable  13 files      test_problem  2 files (1 with a scanned
//   extension) — 14 source files in total, which is exactly what
//   sec-b1-gen-corpus.mjs reports as `counts.sourceFiles`.
// Both generators declare 「Determinism: no Date.now(), no Math.random(), no
// wall-clock」 in their headers, and that claim was verified by measurement, not
// by reading: two consecutive runs of sec-b1-gen-corpus.mjs produced manifests
// that are byte-identical once `provenance` (git sha / dirty tree / node
// version) is removed.
//
// So the solution is: regenerate the corpus in CI from tracked inputs, evaluate
// it, and compare the numbers against a TRACKED baseline. Nothing attack-shaped
// is committed; the gate still has something to compare against.
//
//   ⚠ If a comment in sec-b1-gen-corpus.mjs says "the corpus is committed"
//     (there is one, near the py_compile temp-file handling), it is STALE. The
//     measurement above is authoritative, not the comment.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ The two layers, and which one is the gate
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// There are two outputs and they are NOT interchangeable:
//
//   scripts/sec-selftest-baseline.json   TRACKED. The authority. Every threshold
//                                        and every snapshot the gate compares
//                                        against lives here, in git, reviewable
//                                        in a diff. Changing a threshold is a
//                                        code review, which is the entire point.
//
//   security-experiment/_results/manifest.json
//                                        GITIGNORED local record (§5.5 asks for
//                                        堅牢性メトリクスを固定 here). Rich: raw
//                                        observations, per-gate verdicts, host
//                                        provenance. A CI runner writes it and
//                                        throws it away with the workspace.
//
// The gate NEVER reads _results/ for its expectations. If it did, the baseline
// would be whatever the last run happened to produce and the gate would pass by
// construction — a machine that agrees with itself. _results/manifest.json is a
// report; scripts/sec-selftest-baseline.json is the contract.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ Why the A1 arm's hard gate is STATIC, and why that is not a skip
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A1 is the ReDoS arm, and the tempting gate is wall-clock: run
// sec-a1-redos.mjs / sec-a1-probe.mjs and fail when T(n) climbs. That gate is
// refused here. Both scripts measure elapsed time on a shared GitHub runner,
// where a noisy neighbour moves a 40 ms measurement by more than any regression
// would; a self-hardening gate that cries wolf every fifth build gets marked
// `continue-on-error` within a month and then it protects nothing. The gate's
// credibility IS its product.
//
// The other tempting gate is `recheck`. sec-a1-catalog.mjs says so itself in its
// header: recheck is not a devDependency (it pulls a JVM jar), it is installed
// with `npm install --no-save recheck` only when the experiment is run, and
// without it the script emits `recheck: {available:false}`. On a default CI
// runner it is therefore unavailable.
//
// "recheck is missing, so skip A1" is exactly the vacuous pass this repo forbids.
// So A1 is gated on the part that is always available, always deterministic, and
// that no timing test can see:
//
//   the ATTACK SURFACE CENSUS — how many rules, how many compiled patterns, and
//   WHICH patterns carry a catastrophic shape (nested quantifier / adjacent
//   unbounded quantifiers over overlapping classes / quantified overlapping
//   alternation), pinned as a SET at (ruleId, patternIndex, hit-ids) grain.
//
// This catches the §9.4 accident directly — 「新ルールで super-linear が混入した
// ら fail」 — and it catches it on the day the rule lands, not on the day someone
// happens to write an attack string that reaches its worst case. The complement
// is already covered: packages/analyzer-core/src/redos-invariant.test.ts scans a
// large adversarial battery under `npm test` and asserts the scan stays inside
// DESIGN §11.1's budget. That test can only see patterns its battery happens to
// attack; this census sees every pattern that compiles IN THE TWO RULE LAYERS,
// under the coverage statement below. Neither subsumes the other, and the timing
// half deliberately lives where a generous per-test budget is affordable rather
// than inside a gate that must never flake.
//
// ★ WHICH LAYERS, EXACTLY — the history of this sentence is the reason it is now
// this specific.
//
// It used to read "every pattern that compiles", full stop, and that was false.
// `scripts/sec-a1-catalog.mjs:82` sets `RULES_ENTRY =
// 'packages/rules/dist/index.js'` and enumerates `allRules` from it;
// `packages/analysis-graph` — the cross-file design-smell layer, which ships in
// the CLI and the Action and whose rules are regex-driven just like the core ones
// — was never loaded, so a catastrophic pattern added to a cross-file rule left
// every gate green. That was recorded as MEASURED LIMIT 8 and left standing,
// with the argument that extending the census needed a reflective probe surface
// on `CrossFileRule` and was therefore a rule-interface change.
//
// ★ THAT ARGUMENT WAS WRONG, AND IT WAS MEASURED TO BE WRONG. No interface
// change was needed. `analyze(ctx)` takes a `ProjectIndex`, and the package
// already exports `collectProjectFiles` / `buildProjectIndex` / `createBudget`;
// building an index over `samples/crossfile-fixtures` and calling `analyze`
// directly gives the `RegExp.prototype.exec` hook exactly as much to hook as
// `match(ctx)` does — measured, 332 (rule, pattern) pairs across all 11
// registered cross-file rules, 0 rules silent, 0 invocation errors. The limit
// was a design claim held without an experiment, and it survived two releases
// while the cross-file registry grew from four rules to eleven.
//
// `scripts/sec-a1-crossfile-catalog.mjs` is that census, gated here by
// `a1:crossfile-surface-census`, `a1:crossfile-shape-suspicious-set` and
// `a1:crossfile-probe-liveness`. What it does NOT cover is written down in
// MEASURED LIMIT 8, which is now a statement of the residue rather than of the
// whole hole.
//
// recheck is still wired in: when it IS available the gate additionally checks
// its super-linear rule set against the baseline. When it is not, that ONE gate
// reports `unmeasured` — never `pass` — and the baseline records
// `measured: false` with the reason, so a green A1 can never be misread as
// "recheck says the regexes are safe". The inverse is a hard failure: a baseline
// that claims `measured: true` while recheck is absent means a promised
// measurement was not made, and that fails the build.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ Why SETS, not scalars
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// packages/analyzer-core/src/embedded-samples.test.ts gates
// samples/embedded/vulnerable with `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(18)` and says why: a
// floor moves up when a rule is added instead of failing brittlely. That is the
// right call for a floor — and it is structurally blind to SET DRIFT. Twenty-six
// findings where VG-MEM-004 silently stopped firing and two VG-EMB-021 dupes
// appeared is still 26, still ≥ 18, still green, and the product lost a rule.
//
// So the corpus arm pins the MULTISET of `ruleId@file` — sorted, duplicates
// preserved. Sorted-array equality is multiset equality, so it catches both a
// vanished finding and a duplicated one, and the failure names the exact keys
// that appeared and disappeared. A plain set would have lost the multiplicity
// and with it the "two dupes replaced two losses" case above.
//
// Line numbers are deliberately NOT in the key. They move when a fixture is
// reformatted, which is a change to the fixture and not to the detector, and a
// gate that fails on reindentation teaches people to regenerate the baseline
// without reading it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ Why the corpus SCALE is pinned exactly
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the failure mode that makes a robustness gate actively dangerous. If a
// generator quietly degrades — a transform stops applying, the syntax gate
// starts rejecting everything, SOURCE_DIRS resolves to nothing — it emits a tiny
// or empty corpus. ER is then computed over almost nothing, lands at 0.0, sails
// under the ceiling, and the build goes green while the experiment measures
// air. An empty corpus is the strongest possible "pass" and the weakest possible
// evidence.
//
// So the generated scale (source files, pairs, transformed files, transform
// count, and the file count read back off disk) is pinned EXACTLY, not as a
// floor. A floor would still let a transform stop applying to half the
// population while another one compensates — the ER numerator and denominator
// both move and the headline barely twitches. Exact pins mean adding a transform
// is a deliberate baseline edit, reviewed in the same diff as the transform.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ Directionality: which way is a regression?
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   B1 / ER  — evasion rate. Higher is worse. Ceiling gate.
//              Plus a FLOOR on ΔER = ER(pre-D2) − ER(shipped): that is how much
//              of the evasion the D2 canonicalization pre-pass absorbs. A change
//              that quietly disables D2 leaves ER unchanged in both arms and
//              slips past a pure ceiling; ΔER collapsing to 0 catches it.
//   B3 / CR  — concealment rate. Higher is worse. Ceiling gate on the worst-case
//              row's gated CR, plus a FLOOR on the D1 reduction
//              (CR_ungated − CR_gated) for the same reason: D1 is the severity
//              floor that makes the gated CR 0, and its removal shows up as the
//              reduction shrinking, not as CR rising above a ceiling it was
//              already under.
//              A naive reading of 「CR が baseline 下限を割ったら fail」 as "gated
//              CR must not FALL" would be wrong — a falling CR is the defence
//              working. The quantity with a genuine lower bound is the
//              reduction, and that is what is floored here.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ★ MEASURED LIMITS (things that were checked and came back inconvenient)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  1. sec-b1-er-eval.mjs EXITS 0 EVEN WHEN ITS OWN ASSERTIONS ARE BROKEN. Its
//     tail writes the JSON and prints "⚠ BROKEN" with no process.exit. Gating on
//     the child's exit code alone is therefore a vacuous pass, and this script
//     reads `assertionsAllOk` / `assertionsBroken` / `structuralViolations` out
//     of the JSON instead. Same for sec-b3-cr-eval.mjs.
//  2. THE B1 SCALE PIN HAS AN ENVIRONMENT DEPENDENCY. The generator's G0 syntax
//     gate spawns `python3 -m py_compile`; on this tree 201 of 416 transformed
//     files were validated by it and 0 pairs were rejected at G0. If python3 is
//     absent the spawn fails, `checkSyntax` records `failed`, and those 201
//     pairs are DROPPED — the exact scale pin then fails for an environmental
//     reason. It is not hidden: a scale mismatch prints the rejection-stage
//     census and the syntax-tool census beside it, so the failure reads
//     "608 transform-gate, 201 G0-syntax (python3 -m py_compile)" instead of an
//     unexplained 215 ≠ 416. ubuntu-latest ships python3, which is why the pin
//     is exact rather than weakened to a floor.
//  3. PINNING THE SHAPE-SUSPICIOUS RULE COUNT WOULD BE TOO COARSE.
//     a1-regex-catalog.json reports `suspiciousRulesByShape: 4`, but those 4
//     rules carry 7 suspicious PATTERNS (VG-QUAL-007 alone has three). An eighth
//     suspicious pattern added to an already-suspicious rule leaves the rule
//     count at 4. The pin is therefore at (ruleId, patternIndex, hit-ids) grain.
//  4. b3-cr.json CARRIES A CLOCK READ (`provenance.evaluator.generatedAt`). The
//     gated `observed` object copies metric fields only and never a provenance
//     block, so two runs of this script produce an identical `observed` and an
//     identical `observedDigest`. Host provenance lives in the ungated
//     `environment` block of _results/manifest.json.
//  5. THE _results LAYER WAS ALREADY STALE WHEN THIS WAS WRITTEN, which is the
//     concrete argument for the two-layer split above rather than a theoretical
//     one. The `a1-regex-catalog.json` sitting in `_results/` before the first
//     run of this script reported 47 rules / 84 patterns / `recheck.available:
//     true`; regenerating it against the current tree gives 71 rules / 127
//     patterns / `recheck.available: false`. Twenty-four rules and forty-three
//     patterns of attack surface had appeared since that file was written, and
//     nothing said so. A gate that had taken `_results/` as its expectation
//     would have been comparing today's engine against a snapshot of an engine
//     from before the embedded rules existed.
//     The same comparison is reassuring in the other direction: the pre-existing
//     `b1-er-eval.json` and `b3-cr.json` — produced by someone else, on an
//     earlier run — carry ER 0.240506/0.189873 over 416 pairs and worst-case CR
//     1→0 over 394 pairs, which is exactly what regeneration reproduced. The
//     baseline numbers below are therefore not an artefact of one run on one
//     machine.
//  6. NOT VERIFIED ON THE CI PLATFORM. Every number in the baseline was recorded
//     on win32 / node v24, and the CI job runs ubuntu-latest / node 20. Nothing
//     the gate reads is documented as version-dependent — regex semantics, the
//     rule catalogue, the ER/CR arithmetic and the finding sets are all pure JS
//     over tracked inputs — but "should be identical" is a prediction, not a
//     measurement, and the one plausible divergence is real: the B1 scale pin
//     depends on `python3` being present (limit 2 above) and on `node --check`
//     accepting the same goal for the same bytes. The baseline therefore records
//     `recordedFrom.{nodeVersion,platform}` so a first-run CI failure can be read
//     as "recorded elsewhere" instead of as a regression. If it does diverge, the
//     fix is to re-record on the CI platform — never to loosen the pin.
//  7. THE CROSS-FILE LAYER IS OUT OF SCOPE HERE, deliberately — BUT THE RULE
//     LAYER'S BEHAVIOUR OVER THE CROSS-FILE CORPORA IS NOT, AND USED TO BE.
//     `packages/analysis-graph` is a package this script does not load; folding
//     the graph in would put a graph dependency in the middle of a rule-layer
//     gate, so the cross-file RULES stay in their own suites. That much is
//     unchanged.
//     ★ What changed (#34 CFGATE, 2026-08-03): the corpora those rules are
//     calibrated against are still ordinary directories of source, and
//     `vibeguard <dir>` in its default mode runs the RULE layer over them. That
//     output is what a user sees, and nothing was checking it. Measured before
//     deciding: the rule layer produces 8 findings over the 734 files of
//     `samples/crossfile-fixtures` (4 of them the Django negative control
//     described at CORPUS_DIRS), and 0 over `samples/crossfile-safe` and
//     `samples/design-safe`.
//     `samples/design-safe` is left to `security-scan.yml`, which already gates
//     it at zero through the packaged CLI; adding a second authority for the
//     same contract is how two numbers with the same name start disagreeing.
//     ⚠ CORRECTED TWICE, and the second correction is the one that closed it.
//     (1) This comment originally said `security-scan.yml` covered
//     `samples/crossfile-safe` too. It does not: the samples job has eight steps
//     (safe, vulnerable, embedded × 2, design-safe, design-smells, proto-safe,
//     proto-pollution) and none of them names any cross-file corpus. The zero was
//     real and nothing held it.
//     (2) #49 XFSAFE-GATE then pinned `crossfile-safe` AND `crossfile-vulnerable`
//     in CORPUS_DIRS below. The reasoning that left them unpinned at (1) — "the
//     fix belongs in the job that owns the packaged-CLI contract, adding it here
//     makes two authorities" — was wrong on its own terms: the two-authority
//     objection is why `samples/design-safe` stays out, and design-safe already
//     HAS an authority. These two had none, so this adds the first, not the
//     second. Recorded rather than rewritten, because the failure being described
//     is a comment that asserted a gate into existence, and deleting the trail
//     would leave the same claim standing with nothing behind it.
//     Recorded so "the corpus arm covers the corpora" is not read as covering
//     the cross-file RULES — it does not, and limit 8 is where that gap lives.
//  8. THE A1 CENSUS NOW COVERS BOTH RULE LAYERS — THIS IS WHAT IT STILL MISSES.
//     This limit used to read "the census covers `packages/rules` only … a
//     super-linear pattern added to a cross-file rule passes every gate here",
//     and that was true and growing: `packages/analysis-graph` held 4 cross-file
//     rules when it was written and 11 when it was closed.
//     `scripts/sec-a1-crossfile-catalog.mjs` closes it in two arms and three
//     gates. MEASURED at the time of writing: 11 registered cross-file rules,
//     0 rule-shaped exports outside the registry, 23 built files carrying 194
//     regex literals and 24 `new RegExp(` construction sites, 332 (rule, pattern)
//     pairs executed over 130 fixture projects, and 0 shape-suspicious patterns
//     in either arm. Falsified by construction, on a scratchpad copy: injecting
//     `/(\s+)+$/` as a literal moves `staticLiterals` 194→195 and puts 4 entries
//     in the suspicious set (both new gates fail); injecting the same pattern via
//     `new RegExp(String.raw`(\s+)+$`)` leaves `staticLiterals` at 194 — no
//     literal scan can see it — and is caught by the runtime arm instead.
//     ★ THE RESIDUE, which is what this limit now records:
//      8a. A pattern CONSTRUCTED in a branch no fixture reaches is counted (its
//          `new RegExp(` site is in the static census) but NOT shape-checked,
//          because nothing resolves its interpolations. Measured: injecting
//          `(\s+)+$` into a function no fixture calls moves
//          `staticConstructionSites` 24→25, so `a1:crossfile-surface-census`
//          FAILS and forces a deliberate baseline edit — but
//          `a1:crossfile-shape-suspicious-set` stays green and the catalogue's
//          own `--check` exits 0. The count is the whole defence there.
//      8b. The dynamic pattern COUNT is a function of the fixture tree, not of
//          the build (332 pairs over 130 fixture projects in the working tree
//          that recorded this, 270 over the 86 tracked in git at that moment), so
//          it is FLOORED, not pinned. A driver that half-degrades stays green
//          until it crosses the floor; the exact checks beside it (every rule
//          executed a pattern, four named product regexes observed) are what make
//          a degradation legible before then.
//      8c. No automaton oracle. `recheck` is wired into the CORE catalogue only;
//          the cross-file arm is shape-heuristic only, so its 0 suspicious
//          patterns is a claim about SHAPES and not a proof of linearity.
//      8e. The construction-site count is TEXTUAL and does not know what a
//          comment is: the scan counts occurrences of the constructor token in
//          the built JS, so PROSE mentioning it moves the number. Found the
//          hard way on 2026-08-03 — a comment added to `authz-lexicon.ts`,
//          explaining that the patterns below are constructed rather than
//          literal, took `staticConstructionSites` 24 → 25 and failed this gate.
//          The gate was right to fail (it cannot tell prose from code) and the
//          comment was reworded rather than the baseline raised. If this gate
//          fails and the delta is 1, check whether someone just wrote the token
//          in a sentence before assuming a regex was added.
//      8d. `packages/analysis-graph`'s non-rule regexes (structure indexer,
//          dependency graph, symbol table, taint) ARE in the static census — they
//          run over attacker-sized file content too — and are captured at runtime
//          under the pseudo-rule `(project-index)`. They are NOT attributed to any
//          rule, because they belong to none.

  // as "the population the corpus was derived from" for the evasion
  // evaluation, and `sec-b3-cr-eval.mjs` re-scans it for the concealment one.
  // Adding specimens there moves ΔER and the D1 reduction floor, which is
  // measured before-and-after evidence about the rule layer's evasion
  // resistance — numbers that mean nothing if the population underneath them
  // changes between readings. Measured while the files were briefly in
  // `samples/vulnerable`: `b1:delta-er-floor` fell 0.050633 → 0.045016 and
  // `b3:d1-reduction-floor` fell 1 → 0.785714. Neither is a defect in the new
  // rules; both are what happens when you enlarge the denominator of a ratio
  // mid-experiment.
  //
  // So this pair gets its own gate ids, the existing corpora stay pinned at
  // 51 and 0, and the evasion numbers keep comparing like with like. If the
  // new rules should be inside the evasion population, that is a deliberate
  // re-derivation of the B1/B3 corpora and a re-baseline of both, not a side
  // effect of dropping three files into a directory.

  // ★ #34 CFGATE — the cross-file fixture tree, scanned by the RULE LAYER.
  //
  // This corpus exists for `packages/analysis-graph`, and its own suites run the
  // cross-file rules over it. Nothing ran the SINGLE-FILE rules over it, which is
  // a different question and the one a user actually asks: `vibeguard <dir>` in
  // its default mode runs the rule layer, so whatever the rule layer says about
  // these 734 files is output somebody sees, and no gate was looking at it.
  //
  // It was not empty. `smell-010-py-neg-django/shop/views.py` produces four
  // `VG-SMELL-012` at medium — a fixture whose docstring declares that
  // authorization is centralised in `urls.py` and `LoginRequiredMixin`. Both
  // things are true at once: it is a valid negative control for VG-SMELL-010
  // (which stays silent), and it really does compare a role to a string literal
  // four times, which is what VG-SMELL-012 is about. The finding is not the
  // defect; the defect was that nobody would have noticed either way.
  //
  // Pinned as a SNAPSHOT rather than gated as `-eq 0` deliberately. A count floor
  // of zero over a directory of negative controls is the vacuous-pass shape this
  // file already had to close once (see `files` below): it passes on an empty
  // tree, and it also forces the reading that every finding here is a bug, which
  // the Django case shows is false. The snapshot says what the rule layer says
  // TODAY, and any movement — a new fixture that fires, a rule that starts
  // reaching in here, a negative control that stops being negative — is a diff a
  // human reads.
  'samples/crossfile-fixtures',
  // ★ #49 XFSAFE-GATE — the two cross-file DEMO corpora, for the same reason and
  // by the same mechanism as the fixture tree above.
  //
  // #34 pinned `crossfile-fixtures` and left these two alone on the strength of a
  // sentence that turned out to be false: the comment at limit 7 asserted that
  // `security-scan.yml` already gated `crossfile-safe`, and it does not — the
  // samples job has eight steps and none of them names any cross-file corpus.
  // Nothing anywhere read the rule layer's output over these directories.
  //
  // MEASURED before pinning (default mode, `config: false`, this checkout):
  // `crossfile-safe` 0 findings over 11 files, `crossfile-vulnerable` 0 over 10.
  // Both zeros are real, and until now nothing held either of them.
  //
  // ★ WHY BOTH, WHEN THE ITEM ONLY NAMED THE SAFE HALF. `crossfile-vulnerable`
  // measured zero as well, from the same absence of a gate. Pinning one and not
  // the other would leave the identical hole open next to a closed one, which is
  // how the original false sentence came to be believed in the first place.
  //
  // ★ WHY HERE AND NOT IN `security-scan.yml`. Three reasons, in order of weight:
  //   1. A `-eq 0` step passes over an EMPTIED directory. These corpora are 11 and
  //      12 files — the size at which "someone moved the fixtures" is a live
  //      failure mode. The `files` census below fails first and names the missing
  //      fixtures; a count floor of zero cannot.
  //   2. `README.md` states as a DESIGN decision that the cross-file corpora are
  //      not in the samples job, because their own rules run only behind
  //      `--include-design-smells`. Adding them there would contradict a
  //      documented decision; adding them here does not, because what is pinned
  //      is the SINGLE-FILE rule layer's output, which is a different question
  //      from the one that sentence answers.
  //   3. #34 already answered this exact question for `crossfile-fixtures` and
  //      answered it here. A second dialect of the same gate is how two numbers
  //      with the same name start disagreeing.
  // The "two authorities" objection that keeps `samples/design-safe` out of this
  // list does not apply: design-safe already HAS an authority in the samples job,
  // and these two had none. This adds the first, not the second.

 * This closes most of that; what it deliberately does NOT do is fold the
 * cross-file numbers into `a1:surface-census`, because the two layers are not
 * measurable on the same axis:
 *
 *   - a core rule's pattern set is a function of the BUILD (one inert probe
 *     string reaches all of them), so it can be pinned exactly;
 *   - a cross-file rule builds patterns FROM THE INPUT it analyses
 *     (`new RegExp(String.raw`\b${escaped}\b`)` over identifiers read out of the
 *     file), so the count of patterns it executes is a function of the FIXTURE
 *     TREE. Measured: 332 (rule, pattern) pairs over the 130 fixture projects in
 *     a working tree, 270 over the 86 that were tracked at the time of writing.
 *
 * Pinning that number exactly would produce a gate that fails whenever a fixture
 * is added — and a gate people re-record without reading is worse than no gate.
 * So the cross-file arm is pinned on the axis that IS a function of the build
 * (regex literals and `new RegExp(` construction sites in the built package) and
 * floored on the axis that is not, with the liveness properties that make a low
 * number legible — every rule executed at least one pattern, and four named
 * product regexes were observed — checked exactly.
