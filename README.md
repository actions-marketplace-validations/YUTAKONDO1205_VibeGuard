Author : Kondo Yuta （近藤 悠太）

VibeGuard is a security scanner for AI-generated code. It catches the bugs that "looks fine, ships fine" code tends to hide: missing input checks, hard-coded passwords, skipped login checks, exceptions silently caught, and so on.

You can run it at three places:

- **While you write** — VS Code extension. Save the file, see findings inline.
- **While you read** — Chrome extension. Scan code snippets on any web page.
- **Before you merge** — CLI and GitHub Action. Block a PR when something risky lands.

All three run the same analysis engine, so a finding looks the same in your editor, in your browser, and in the PR comment.

**What "the same" does and does not mean.** Given the same engine version, the same input, and the same `mode`, the core returns the same verdict everywhere. Two things can still make one surface report differently from another, and neither is a bug:

- **Mode defaults differ.** The VS Code on-save scan defaults to `fast`; the CLI, the Action, and the Chrome extension use `standard`. `standard` runs rules that `fast` skips, so a file can be clean on save and flag in CI. Set `vibeguard.scanOnSaveMode` to `standard` in VS Code if you want them to agree, or use `VibeGuard: Scan File`, which always runs `standard`.
- **What reaches the engine differs.** Each surface decides what counts as "the input": VS Code passes a file, the CLI walks a directory, the Chrome extension extracts code blocks from a page and joins them into one snippet. Same engine, different text in — so different findings out.

For more detail: the design document is in [docs/DESIGN.ja.md](docs/DESIGN.ja.md) (Japanese). The privacy policy is in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) — VibeGuard never sends your code anywhere.

## Install

VibeGuard is published on four channels. All of them run the same analysis engine, so the verdict on a given snippet is identical across editor, browser, and CI.

| Channel | Where to get it | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **VS Code Marketplace** | [marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yutakondo.vibeguard-aicoding](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yutakondo.vibeguard-aicoding) | Inline diagnostics on save while you write code in VS Code. Publisher `yutakondo`, extension `vibeguard-aicoding`. |
| **Open VSX Registry** | [open-vsx.org/extension/yutakondo/vibeguard-aicoding](https://open-vsx.org/extension/yutakondo/vibeguard-aicoding) | Same VS Code extension, mirrored for VSCodium / Cursor / Gitpod / code-server and other editors that pull from Open VSX instead of the Microsoft Marketplace. |
| **Chrome Web Store** | [chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ggdiodcjmdnkhncnpafcjokgonhmhbdf](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ggdiodcjmdnkhncnpafcjokgonhmhbdf) | Scan code you see in the browser — GitHub PRs, Stack Overflow answers, blog posts, chat windows. Side Panel + right-click "Scan with VibeGuard". 100% local analysis. |
| **GitHub Marketplace (Action)** | [github.com/marketplace/actions/vibe-guard-aicoding](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vibe-guard-aicoding) | Block risky PRs in CI. `uses: YUTAKONDO1205/VibeGuard@v0` — see the [Reusable Action](#reusable-action-github-marketplace) section for inputs / outputs. |

Source of truth for all four channels: this repository (MIT-licensed). The CLI under [`apps/cli`](apps/cli) is the same binary the Action wraps, and the analyzer-core under [`packages/analyzer-core`](packages/analyzer-core) is what powers both extensions.

```

Future additions: `packages/scanner-semgrep` (deep mode), more language rule packs.

`samples/` and `test_problem/` look similar but serve different audiences. `samples/` is split per-rule and is consumed by the `samples` CI job as a regression / false-positive gate. [`test_problem/`](test_problem) is the opposite shape — one Python file that intentionally trips most rule families at once, intended for humans who want to see VibeGuard react without setting up a fixture tree. Editing `test_problem/` does **not** affect the CI gate. See [test_problem/README.md](test_problem/README.md) for the mapping of each section to its rule ID.

## Setup

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## CLI usage

> The CLI is not published to npm, and is not installable on its own. Use it
> either by cloning this repo (`npm install && npm run build`, then
> `node apps/cli/dist/index.js …` as below), or — for CI — via the
> [GitHub Action](#reusable-action-github-marketplace), which wraps the same CLI
> and is the supported path for automation.
>
> The `vibeguard-cli-<version>.tgz` attached to each release is a **source
> archive**, not a self-contained package: it declares `@vibeguard/*`
> dependencies that only exist inside this workspace, so `npm install` on it
> alone fails to resolve them. Making that tarball independently installable
> needs the CLI to be bundled the way the two extensions already are; until then,
> clone the repo.

```bash
# Scan a directory (human-readable output)
node apps/cli/dist/index.js ./samples/vulnerable

# Or try the bundled single-file demo: one Python file that trips every rule family
node apps/cli/dist/index.js ./test_problem/test_problem.py

# Emit SARIF so GitHub Code Scanning can ingest it
node apps/cli/dist/index.js ./src --format sarif --out report.sarif

# Exit non-zero only when something critical is found
node apps/cli/dist/index.js suspicious.py --fail-on critical

# Scan only the lines added in a PR (uses `git diff <range> --unified=0` internally)
node apps/cli/dist/index.js --diff origin/main...HEAD --format markdown

# Preview the deterministic auto-fixes, then apply them
node apps/cli/dist/index.js ./firmware --dry-run
node apps/cli/dist/index.js ./firmware --fix

# Also run the opt-in cross-file pass
node apps/cli/dist/index.js ./src --include-design-smells
```

Main options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--format <human\|json\|sarif\|markdown>` | Output format (default: `human`). `markdown` is meant for PR comments. |
| `--out <file>` | Write the report to a file instead of stdout. |
| `--mode <fast\|standard\|deep>` | Scan depth (default: `standard`). |
| `--fail-on <level>` | Exit non-zero when a finding of this severity (or higher) appears (default: `high`). `never` disables the gate. |
| `--min-confidence <high\|medium\|low>` | Hide findings below this confidence (default: show all). Hidden findings are excluded from `--fail-on` too, so a build can pass even though lower-confidence findings exist — the hidden count is printed to stderr. Best left unset in CI gates; intended for local triage. |
| `--fix` | Apply deterministic auto-fixes to the files on disk. See [Auto-fix](#auto-fix---fix----dry-run). |
| `--dry-run` | Print the fix plan without writing anything. Implies fix mode. |
| `--include-design-smells` | Also run the cross-file design-smell pass over the whole target. Ignored with `--diff`. CLI / Action only. |
| `--ignore <name>` | Extra directory name to skip (repeatable). |
| `--diff <range>` | Scan only lines added in `git diff <range> --unified=0`. |
| `--known-only` | Scan only files with known-language extensions. |
| `--config <path>` | Path to a `.vibeguardrc.json`. Auto-discovered in the scan target when omitted. |
| `--no-config` | Skip config-file auto-discovery. |
| `--no-remediation` | Skip remediation generation. |
| `--no-color` | Disable ANSI colours (also honours `NO_COLOR`). |

`node apps/cli/dist/index.js --help` prints the full list.

### Auto-fix (`--fix` / `--dry-run`)

`--fix` rewrites the files on disk; `--dry-run` prints the same plan and writes nothing. Only rules that carry a **deterministic** fixer are touched, and each applied edit is labelled `safe` or `needs-review`. Everything else keeps the prose remediation, which can describe changes a token swap cannot perform.

The governing rule is that **a fixer must be stricter than the detector that fed it**: where a fixer cannot confirm from the bytes it reads that its edit is the right one, it declines rather than guessing. A declined fix leaves the finding reported.

`--fail-on` applies in fix mode, evaluated against the **pre-fix** findings — that a fix was applied is not evidence that the finding is gone. So fix mode never weakens a gate, and the post-fix verdict comes from re-running the scan rather than from the process that did the writing. Pass `--fail-on never` if you want a fix run to stay advisory.

### Config file (`.vibeguardrc.json`)

Auto-discovered in the scan target (`.vibeguardrc.json` or `vibeguard.config.json`), or pointed at with `--config`; `--no-config` skips discovery. It drives **path-based suppression** — a way to say "this rule does not apply under this tree" without scattering pragmas across every file:

```json
{
  "suppress": [
    {
      "paths": ["samples/vulnerable/**", "**/*.test.ts"],
      "rules": ["VG-INJ-004", "VG-AUTH-003"],
      "reason": "Test fixtures are intentionally vulnerable",
      "expires": "2026-12-31"
    }
  ]
}
```

`paths` is required (globs against the repo-relative path; `**` spans segments). `rules` is optional, and omitting it makes the entry a **wildcard** — which, exactly as with the comment pragmas, **cannot** silence a `critical` / `high` / `medium` finding; such a finding is reported anyway, carrying a `suppressionOverridden` marker. Gating one channel and not the other would only move blanket silencing to the ungated one. `expires` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) drops the entry once the date has passed. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#named-suppression-is-an-escape-hatch-and-it-is-visible).

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Runs every package's `*.test.ts` under vitest.

## Performance benchmark

```bash
npm run build
npm run bench           # human-readable table
npm run bench -- --json # machine-readable for CI artifacts
```

The benchmark exercises three representative workloads (single-file fast scan, samples directory, repo-wide scan) and prints a Markdown table comparing the median of 3 runs against the design targets in [docs/DESIGN.ja.md](docs/DESIGN.ja.md) §11.1. The benchmark exits non-zero when a workload exceeds 2× its target — the 2× headroom keeps the gate quiet on noisy CI VMs while still catching real regressions. A non-blocking `perf-bench` job uploads the JSON to a CI artifact on every push.

## GitHub Actions

The repository ships five workflows:

| Workflow | Role |
|---|---|
| [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | The base gate: `build-test` (`npm ci` → `npm run build` → `npm test`), plus `consistency-e2e` (the Node and browser bundles must return identical findings) and the non-blocking `perf-bench`. |
| [`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`](.github/workflows/security-scan.yml) | Three jobs — self-scan, samples, pr-diff-scan. Self-scan uploads SARIF to Code Scanning and posts a sticky PR comment; samples is the rule-correctness gate; pr-diff-scan posts a separate comment for only the lines added in the PR. |
| [`.github/workflows/no-network-assert.yml`](.github/workflows/no-network-assert.yml) | The no-egress claim, made falsifiable: `static-egress-scan` parses the shipped bytes of all four channels for network sinks (against seeded positive and decoy controls), and `offline-parity` runs the CLI with no connectivity and requires byte-identical findings. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#trust-boundary). |
| [`.github/workflows/action-smoke-test.yml`](.github/workflows/action-smoke-test.yml) | End-to-end verification of `action.yml` via `uses: ./`. |
| [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) | Tag-triggered: builds the CLI tarball / VSIX / Chrome zip, attaches them to the GitHub Release, and publishes the VSIX to the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX. |

### self-scan job
Scans VibeGuard itself with `--fail-on never`, then surfaces the result as SARIF in the Security tab and as Markdown in a sticky PR comment. **It informs but never blocks the build**: rule definition files ([packages/rules/src/rules/](packages/rules/src/rules/)) legitimately contain literals like `eval()` and dummy credentials as regex examples, and test files include intentionally vulnerable code, so requiring 0 findings on the source tree is structurally impossible.

### samples job
The real quality gate for rule correctness. Four corpus **pairs**, each a zero-findings guard against false positives and a floor against regressions. The counts are deliberately **separate per pair** — the rules behind each are language- or opt-in-gated, so one corpus cannot perturb another's number, and a moved count names the corpus that moved.

| safe half (must be 0) | vulnerable half (CI floor) | measured today | per-rule coverage asserted in |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`samples/safe`](samples/safe) | [`samples/vulnerable`](samples/vulnerable) ≥ 15 | 51 | — (floor + the E2 figure in the evaluation docs) |
| [`samples/embedded/safe`](samples/embedded/safe) | [`samples/embedded/vulnerable`](samples/embedded/vulnerable) ≥ 18 | 26 | `embedded-samples.test.ts` |
| [`samples/design-safe`](samples/design-safe) | [`samples/design-smells`](samples/design-smells) ≥ 6 | 23 | `design-samples.test.ts` |
| [`samples/proto-safe`](samples/proto-safe) | [`samples/proto-pollution`](samples/proto-pollution) ≥ 1 | 2 | `design-samples.test.ts` |

The floors sit well below the measured counts on purpose: they catch a rule going dark, while the exact per-rule coverage — which is what a real regression moves — is asserted in the vitest suites named above. The web corpus is the exception: it predates that discipline and is still guarded by the floor and the count alone, so a rule that stopped firing there while another started would not be caught by CI. `samples/vulnerable` also feeds `consistency.test.ts`, which requires the Node and browser bundles to agree finding-for-finding on it.

The **cross-file** corpora ([`samples/crossfile-safe`](samples/crossfile-safe), [`samples/crossfile-vulnerable`](samples/crossfile-vulnerable), [`samples/crossfile-fixtures`](samples/crossfile-fixtures)) are not in this job: their rules only run behind `--include-design-smells`, so they are gated by the tests in `packages/analysis-graph` instead. That covers the cross-file rules and not the other question a user asks — what the ordinary single-file rule layer says when you point `vibeguard` at those directories in its default mode. All three are pinned for that in the `security-selftest` job (`scripts/sec-selftest.mjs`, `CORPUS_DIRS`), as finding **sets** plus a file census, so an emptied or renamed corpus fails instead of quietly passing.

### pr-diff-scan job
Scans only the added lines in a PR and posts a dedicated sticky comment (header `vibeguard-diff`). Fails on `high` or above. The job runs `git diff --unified=0 origin/<base_ref>...HEAD`, reads each changed file from the working tree, runs a full scan, then keeps only the findings that overlap an added line.

### Note
PRs from forks don't get the comment posted (the `pull-requests: write` permission isn't granted to fork workflows). After the first push to `main`, results are aggregated in the GitHub Security tab.

## Reusable Action (GitHub Marketplace)

[`action.yml`](action.yml) at the repository root lets other repos call VibeGuard from a workflow with a single step.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0      # required when using diff scan
- uses: YUTAKONDO1205/VibeGuard@v0
  with:
    path: .
    mode: standard
    format: sarif
    out: vibeguard.sarif
    fail-on: high
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    sarif_file: vibeguard.sarif
    category: vibeguard
```

PR diff-only scan example:

```yaml
- uses: YUTAKONDO1205/VibeGuard@v0
  with:
    diff: origin/${{ github.base_ref }}...HEAD
    format: markdown
    out: report.md
    fail-on: high
```

Main inputs:

| input | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | `.` | Scan target (relative to the consumer repo root). |
| `mode` | `standard` | `fast` / `standard` / `deep`. |
| `format` | `sarif` | `human` / `json` / `sarif` / `markdown`. |
| `fail-on` | `high` | `critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low` / `never`. |
| `min-confidence` | `''` | Hide findings below this confidence (`high` / `medium` / `low`). Hidden findings are excluded from `fail-on` too, so the job can pass even though lower-confidence findings exist. Best left unset in CI gates. |
| `out` | `''` | Report output file (stdout if empty). |
| `diff` | `''` | Scan only lines added in `git diff <range>`. |
| `include-design-smells` | `false` | Also run the cross-file design-smell pass over the whole target. Off by default because it is a different analysis with a different cost profile, and turning it on would change the findings of every existing workflow without anyone asking. Ignored when `diff` is set. |
| `ignore` | `''` | Comma-separated extra ignore directory names. |
| `known-only` | `false` | Scan only known-language extensions. |
| `no-remediation` | `false` | Skip remediation generation. |
| `node-version` | `20` | Node.js version used for the scan. |

outputs:

| output | description |
|---|---|
| `exit-code` | The CLI's exit code (non-zero when `fail-on` is tripped). |
| `output-file` | Absolute path of `out`, when set. |

Marketplace publishing is documented in [`docs/runbooks/publish-action-to-marketplace.md`](docs/runbooks/publish-action-to-marketplace.md). End-to-end verification runs in [`.github/workflows/action-smoke-test.yml`](.github/workflows/action-smoke-test.yml) using `uses: ./`.

## Rule catalogue

74 single-file rules at the moment, across 10 languages (including a C/C++/Arduino embedded layer), plus 11 cross-file rules that run only behind `--include-design-smells` (see below). The ID prefix groups rules by source file; the `category` field is a separate, risk-oriented axis.

| Prefix | Coverage | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `VG-INJ-NNN` | Injection | eval / SQL concatenation / innerHTML / pickle, etc. |
| `VG-AUTH-NNN` | Auth / TLS / placeholder auth | DEBUG bypass / `verify=False` / `dummy_token`. |
| `VG-SEC-NNN` | Hardcoded secrets | AWS keys / PEM / GitHub PAT / high-entropy strings. |
| `VG-CRYPTO-NNN` | Crypto | MD5/SHA1 / `Math.random` / `http://`. |
| `VG-QUAL-001..004` | General quality (CORS / swallowed exceptions / open redirect, etc.) | |
| `VG-QUAL-005..010` | **AI-trace heuristics** (`category: ai-quality`) | Stub implementations / placeholder emails / mock data / `debug=true` / "for now" comments / empty validators. |
| `VG-FW-NNN` | Framework misconfiguration | Django `DEBUG=True` / Flask `app.run(debug=True)` / CORS wildcard. |
| `VG-MEM-NNN` | **C/C++ memory** (`category: memory`) | `gets` / `strcpy`/`sprintf` / `memcpy` sized from `strlen` / same-block double-free & use-after-free. |
| `VG-EMB-NNN` | **AI-generated embedded** (secrets / crypto / ai-quality) | Hard-coded Wi-Fi & BLE creds / cleartext `http://` / `setInsecure()` / `#define DEBUG 1` / auth-bypass flag / credential to serial / "remove before production" / use-before-`begin()`. |
| `VG-RTOS-NNN` | **Interrupt / RTOS** (`category: concurrency`) | Forbidden call inside an ISR body / shared ISR variable missing `volatile` / `O_DIRECT` without `O_SYNC`. |

VG-QUAL-005..010 target the "compiles cleanly but shouldn't ship" patterns that AI-generated code produces. They run at `severity=medium` and `confidence=low~medium` because heuristics are inherently noisier than syntactic rules.

### Cross-file rules (`--include-design-smells`)

Four rules need the whole project rather than one file, so they live in `@vibeguard/analysis-graph` and run only when you pass `--include-design-smells`. That package is **not** bundled into the Chrome or VS Code extensions (a packaging invariant checks it), so these rules are CLI- and Action-only.

| Rule | What it reports |
|---|---|
| `VG-SMELL-010` | **Scattered authorization** — the same privilege decision re-derived inline in ≥3 route handlers across ≥2 files, instead of in one guard. Severity rises to `high` on a privilege word, a security-worded path, or a data-store write in the handler. |
| `VG-AISC-002` | A call into a **known SDK namespace whose member no member header declares** — the hallucinated-API shape, reported only when the project's own quoted includes all resolve. |
| `VG-AISC-003` | A **security initialiser that is defined and never named anywhere else** in the project. |
| `VG-RTOS-003` | An **ISR-written shared variable missing `volatile`, where the reader is in another file** — the cross-file half of `VG-RTOS-002`. |

These are lexical-structural, not AST-based, and three of the four (`VG-AISC-002`, `VG-AISC-003`, `VG-RTOS-003`) cap `confidence` at `medium` for the same reason: their evidence is that a lexical scan did **not** find something — no header declares this member, this token appears nowhere else, this declaration has no `volatile` — which is the weakest kind of evidence the project ships on. A generated header, a linker-supplied symbol, or a declaration behind an unevaluated preprocessor conditional produces the same shape with nothing wrong. `VG-SMELL-010` reaches `high` confidence only where the pattern is emphatic enough for that uncertainty to stop mattering (≥5 sites across ≥3 files). Rule IDs are unique across the two packages, so the number does not tell you which one a rule is in — the split is by analysis scope, not by subject.

Details, including the packaging invariant that keeps this package out of the extension bundles, are in [`packages/analysis-graph/README.md`](packages/analysis-graph/README.md).

The C/C++/Arduino layer (`VG-MEM`/`VG-EMB`/`VG-RTOS`, plus the `.ino`/`.hh`/`.cxx`/`.ipp` extensions and a preprocessor-branch normalization face) is regex-and-lexical only — **no `tree-sitter` or other parser dependency** — so it ships to all four channels. `VG-EMB` is the intended focus: valid C that is a security problem because of *how AI writes firmware* (a hard-coded SSID is legal C, so existing embedded static analyzers stay silent). `VG-MEM` is a deliberate floor with no novelty (flawfinder/cppcheck territory).

**Deliberately NOT detected in the embedded layer** (kept out because a lexical scanner cannot decide them without a parser or dataflow, and forcing them would manufacture false positives):
- *Memory (17d):* destination-size-checked `memcpy`, use-after-free / double-free across any control flow, integer overflow before `malloc`, constant array-index out of bounds.
- *AI-embedded (17e):* CRC misused as an integrity/authenticity check (intent, not syntax), entropy/content-based "does this flash string look secret", cross-function/cross-file init order, power-management sequencing, hard-coded SD paths, `digitalWrite` before `pinMode` (indistinguishable from the documented glitch-free-init idiom), and **a debug UART left initialised in a production build** — `Serial.begin(…)` / `HAL_UART_Init(…)` is lexically identical whether the port drives a debug console or a GPS, a modem, a sensor, or field diagnostics, and nearly every legitimate Arduino sketch opens one, so the rule would fire on `samples/embedded/safe` and break the zero-findings contract. What is actually harmful about a live debug port is already covered by other rules: `VG-EMB-020` for the debug flag itself, `VG-EMB-021` for the bypass it usually guards, and `VG-EMB-022` for secrets printed to the port. An open port with none of those is an attack-surface note, not a finding.
- *RTOS (17f):* `xTaskCreate` stack-size magic number (unit is words on vanilla FreeRTOS, bytes on ESP-IDF — any threshold is wrong somewhere), hard-coded task priorities, and mutex acquire-order / priority inversion (needs a cross-function lock graph).

Each rule declares a *default* confidence, and the analyzer then applies a **context-window confidence correction**: a match that sits inside a comment, docstring, or block comment, or on a test/fixture/mock path, has its confidence down-ranked (never up-ranked, and severity is untouched), so a pattern shown inside a docstring is reported at lower confidence than a live one.

The correction is **severity-gated**: a finding whose severity is `critical` or `high` keeps its declared confidence even in those contexts, and one whose severity is `medium` may be down-ranked but never below `medium` — the default actionable threshold — so a real finding cannot be buried by wrapping it in a docstring. `low` and `info` take the full down-rank, where the noise reduction is worth most and the abuse impact least. Down-ranking exists to quiet triage noise — it is a utility mechanism, not a security verdict — and anyone who can write the file can also choose where a pattern sits, so a context that lowers confidence must never lower it for a finding that matters. See `SEVERITY_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` in `packages/rules/src/confidence.ts`, and run `node scripts/e6-confidence-eval.mjs` for a worked demonstration that reports both arms (un-gated and gated) side by side.

## Chrome extension

`extensions/chrome/` is a minimal Manifest V3 extension (Phase 3). It uses the analyzer-core `./browser` sub-path so the bundle contains no `node:fs` / `node:path`, and runs the analyzer from the Side Panel.

| Feature | How to invoke |
|---|---|
| Show Side Panel | Click the VibeGuard icon in the toolbar. |
| Paste-scan | Paste code into the Side Panel textarea and press **Scan**. |
| Extract from page | Side Panel → **Extract from page** collects `<pre><code>` blocks from the active tab and scans them. |
| Scan PR diff | On a GitHub `/pull/<n>` (Files-changed) tab, Side Panel → **Scan PR diff** walks the diff table, scans each touched file as a reconstructed pseudo-content, and reports findings grouped by file. Findings are filtered to those that overlap an *added* line. Re-running the button rescans the current page. |
| Selection scan | Select text on any page → context menu → `Scan with VibeGuard` (opens the Side Panel and scans immediately). |
| History | The bottom **History** section persists the most recent 50 scan results in `chrome.storage.local`, which survives browser restarts. Each entry holds the summary, finding metadata (rule/severity/path/line — no snippets, no remediation), **and `codePreview`: the first 200 characters of the scanned text, stored verbatim.** That preview is raw code for a pasted or extracted scan, so a credential in the first 200 characters is stored as written; for PR scans it is a file-name list instead. Click **Clear** to wipe it. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md). |
| Language picker | `auto-detect` or js / ts / python / go / java / ruby / php / csharp. |

Build:

```bash
npm run build -w vibeguard-chrome
```

Point Chrome at `extensions/chrome/dist/` via `chrome://extensions` → **Load unpacked**. `npm run watch -w vibeguard-chrome` keeps esbuild rebuilding on save.

## Development phases

| Phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| 1 (MVP) | analyzer-core, 20–30 base rules, findings-schema, SARIF output, CLI, minimal VS Code extension. |
| 2 | GitHub Actions, PR comments, fail gates, CodeQL co-existence. |
| 3 | Chrome extension (code extraction / Side Panel / PR diff scan). |
| 4 | Smarter AI-driven remediation, org policies, more languages, dashboards. |

Phases 1–3 are in place. Phase 4 has started at its least speculative end: `--fix` applies **deterministic** fixes only, and `.vibeguardrc.json` is the beginning of policy-as-config — neither is AI-driven remediation, which stays future work.

## Versioning

VibeGuard tracks **two independent version numbers**. Keeping them separate is intentional — reference the right one when reporting issues.

| Version | Where | Bumps when | Current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tool version** | `package.json` of each channel; CLI `--version`; SARIF `tool.version` | Any release of the published artifact — packaging, UX, docs, or detection changes. | `0.3.6` |
| **Engine version** | `ENGINE_VERSION` in [`analyzer-core`](packages/analyzer-core); every scan result and SARIF report as `engineVersions.core` | Only when **detection behavior** changes (rules, analysis, finding schema). | `0.3.3` |

A third number appears only on scans that ran the opt-in cross-file pass (`--include-design-smells`): `engineVersions['analysis-graph']`, currently `0.3.0-beta.4`. It moves on its own axis, because nothing about it can change a scan that did not ask for it — and the pre-release marker is not decoration: the cross-file analysis indexes lexically rather than parsing.

The CLI prints the first two, e.g. `vibeguard 0.3.6 (engine 0.3.3)`. The tool version is read from `package.json` at runtime, so it always matches the published package. That the two currently differ is the table working rather than drift: engine `0.3.1` shipped in tool `0.3.2`, and tool `0.3.3` corrected a Chrome manifest version that had blocked the `0.3.2` submission — a packaging fix that moved no rule, so the engine stayed put. The engine stayed at `0.1.0` while the tool advanced to `0.1.3`, because those releases (vsce metadata fix, OK-state UX, license) did not change what VibeGuard detects, and it was then held there deliberately through a round of detection work so that one version would name one settled engine rather than several successive ones. `0.2.0` released that hold: context-window confidence and its severity gate, the canonicalizer pre-pass, regex time/length bounds with `degradations`, `confidenceAudit`, the suppression severity gate, `match-limit` reporting, and the suppression tally. `0.2.1` adds the C/C++/Arduino embedded layer (VG-MEM/VG-EMB/VG-RTOS, the `.ino`/`.hh`/`.cxx`/`.ipp` extensions, and the N_pp preprocessor face) — purely additive, so web-language verdicts are unchanged. `0.3.0` adds the single-file design smells (VG-SMELL-003/004/012), the hallucinated-dependency rule (VG-AISC-001) with its lockfile veto, prototype-polluting merges (VG-INJ-020), and per-match severity escalation — also additive: no rule that existed at `0.2.1` changed what it matches. `0.3.1` is the first bump that is NOT additive: it corrects existing rules in both directions, after a deep audit found defects in them. `VG-INJ-005` stops reporting `Loader=SafeLoader` as critical (fewer findings); `VG-SMELL-012` stops being disabled by a string that merely mentions `Object.freeze` and the canonical/raw merge stops dropping a real finding as a duplicate of a comment (more findings); C/C++ line-continuation comments, JS template substitutions and `return /re/` are classified correctly. A file's verdict may therefore differ between `0.3.0` and `0.3.1` — which is exactly what this axis exists to tell you. `0.3.4` leaves the engine at `0.3.1` and moves the *third* axis instead: it is the first release to ship the cross-file pass as a beta (`0.3.0-alpha.1` → `0.3.0-beta.3`, four rules → eleven), so a default scan is unchanged while a `--include-design-smells` run is not. It also narrows what `--fix` will write, and makes `--fail-on` apply in fix mode — a breaking change for anyone who ran `--fix` in CI. `0.3.5` moves the engine to `0.3.2`: two C/C++ rules are added (`VG-MEM-006`, `VG-AUTH-008`), so a scan of C or C++ sources can report more than it did at `0.3.1`, while every other language is untouched. `0.3.6` moves BOTH of the other two axes and adds no rule to either. The engine goes to `0.3.3` because the lockfile veto that refutes hallucinated-dependency findings moved into `analyzer-core`, which changes what the VS Code extension reports on a `standard` scan (it previously applied no veto at all, so it showed false positives the CLI had already refuted — though not on the on-save default, since `VG-AISC-001` is `medium` and `fast` runs only critical and high) and gives `declaredPackageVetoes` an observable empty state, distinguishing "no lockfile reached this scan" from "the veto ran and removed nothing"; the CLI's and Chrome's verdicts are unchanged. The cross-file axis goes to `0.3.0-beta.4` because `VG-SMELL-013` can now see file-route conventions such as a Next.js `pages/api` tree, where it previously never reached its decision point — findings can only be added by that, never removed. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what each one changes. To compare against the engine from before the `0.2.0` detection work, use the `v0.1.3` (pre-hold) or `v0.2.0` (pre-embedded) tags.

**Rule of thumb:** compare results across two runs by **engine version** (same engine, same input, same `mode` ⇒ identical verdicts); report which build you installed by **tool version**. The `mode` qualifier matters: `fast` and `standard` run different rule sets, and VS Code's on-save default is `fast` while every other surface defaults to `standard`.
